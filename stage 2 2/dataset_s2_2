[{"body": "It feels too close for comfort for me, but aside from yall, I'm alone in my concerns.  \n\nMy friends were on the previous Grand Princess cruise.  The county dept of health &amp; Princess cruises contacted them by phone but since it was more than 14 days ago, they're not candidates for further follow up.    My Ma flew into Ontario airport the same day the Wuhan/March AFB evacuees were being sent home after their 14 days, the same day there was unclear news of one of them testing positive &amp; being released from a hospital in San Diego &amp; at a point where there was word from China that it was airborne.   \n\nIt is my opinion we'll be hearing Spanish Flu (even) more over the coming weeks-I don't think there's anything else this can be compared to for bad luck, virulence &amp; bad decisions.  It's undecided whether the Spanish Flu came from America or China.  It's unclear how it got it's name, but I think it might be because Spain was one of the only countries that wasn't censoring the news &amp; instead was reporting it in gory detail.

They\u2019re used to being under centralized command and are mentally  prepared to [be away](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-doctors-nurses.html) from their families to protect our country.\n\nWe should rapidly reassign any military doctors and paramedics that  can be spared to serve domestic needs. Other service members who need  specialized skill training can be sent to coronavirus  treatment-and-control bootcamps, where they can be trained to aid  nurses, respiratory therapists and maintenance technicians.\n\nOur trained service members can be deployed wherever the demand is  greatest. They can monitor patients and take vitals. They can staff  triage checkpoints at hospital entrances. And they can help manage  equipment inventory and disinfection procedures. Further, military  pilots and transportation specialists can increase the capacity of our [air](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-italy-hospitals-doctor-lockdown-quarantine-intensive-care-a9401186.html) and [ground](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-17/coronavirus-threatens-to-thin-the-ranks-of-police-firefighters-and-others-on-the-front-lines) ambulance services.\n\nServing on the frontlines always involves substantial risk.

And as China\u2019s [CDC reports](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130),  young and healthy individuals are least likely to require hospital  resources if infected.

We don\u2019t need to militarize our hospitals.  But our hospitals will need help from our military. Let\u2019s get our  service members prepared. And let\u2019s get them on the frontlines.\n\nWhen our men and women enlist into the [US military](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military),  they do it with the most admirable and courageous goals: to serve and  protect their fellow Americans and to keep our country strong.

I don't think it's ever gotten more than 10 reads.\n\n\nAnyway, here's the copy/paste:\n\n\n\nI draw dinosaurs.\n\n\nI draw lots of things actually.  Cartoons, dragons, animals, landscaping plans for my backyard, pretty much anything I feel like.  However, it's the dinosaurs that I really like to draw.  They have a strange way of bringing a sort of peace over me, and I've drawn them for as long as I can remember.\n\n\nThis might seem odd.  After all, there aren't many 32 year old men who draw dinosaurs, let alone for therapeutic purposes.  For years I didn't really know why drawing dinosaurs had such an effect on me.  It was just something I did, especially when I was under stress or feeling a little blue.  I'd grab a pad and a No. 2 and just let my mind wonder the Mesozoic.\n\n\nIt wasn't until a few years ago that I began to understand the cause of this peculiar behavior of mine.  It was 2011, and my dad had just attempted suicide by driving his work van into a telephone pole at a high speed.\n\n\nHang on... I should back up a moment.\n\n\nMy dad, or my *\"kid\"* as my brother and I often call him, has some problems in his life.  And by *some* I mean a *lot*.  In fact he's always had a lot of problems in his life.  I'm actually quite surprised that he's managed to survive to the ripe old age of 53.  Well, it all started when he was a little boy.  You see, he was a victim of rather severe child abuse.  I won't go into details, but if you used your imagination, you'd probably be right.  Anyway, It fucked him up pretty bad.  Before the age of 12 he was institutionalized twice for attempting to harm himself.  His first real suicide attempt occurred when he was only 16.  His girlfriend had broken up with him, and he decided to drive his Chevy Nova into [the canal at 43rd Avenue and Peoria](https://www.google.com/maps/@33.581924,-112.151544,3a,34.1y,295.82h,83.77t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1saK10SYvTCdgCbgus9YwUJA!2e0?hl=en).  He ended up in the ICU for about two weeks and eventually recovered.\n\n\nThe incident left him with some rather dashing facial scars and a new lease on life.  Publicly speaking, the suicide attempt was turned into a *tragic accident*, which resulted in him becoming pretty well known at his high school.  By the time he was 18 he had developed a persona of badassery.  It was a mask, of course, to cover his severe anxiety and depression.  However, he was physically resilient at this point, a tough kid with a knack for fighting.  He quickly became very popular, especially with the druggies (most of which are fat middle aged bikers nowadays... except for the three of four who died over the years while riding drunk anyway).  When my swooning mother, then 16 and quite unsupervised, first laid eyes on this beefcake, he hadn't yet gotten into drugs.  Sure, he swilled down beer on the weekends, and smoked a joint from time to time.  Things necessary to maintain his machismo, and maybe numb the pain that periodically reared its ugly head.  But my mom saw a survivor, a tough guy with a good heart inside.  She was pregnant with yours truly at 17.\n\n\nI swear to God I'm explaining why I draw dinosaurs.\n\n\nAnyway, fast forward a little ways.  My baby brother is newly hatched, and I'm 3, recently graduated to accelerated booger-picker.  It's the 80's.  The economy is shit, and money is tight.  My rough and tumble father now worked in a La Corona yogurt factory.  It was steady work, but didn't pay very well.  I suppose my mom had expected a lot more from him.  Someone as brave and charismatic as my father had originally seemed to her, isn't supposed to work in a yogurt factory hardly scraping enough cash in to pay the bills.  Anyway, she really pressured him to bring in more money, and his inability to do so caused him a great deal of sorrow.  My dad didn't respond well to feelings of inadequacy, and rapidly slipped into depression.\n\n\nNow, if he had cut ties with the dredges of his high school alumni, things would have turned out differently in the long run.  I wouldn't even be explaining why I draw dinosaurs right now.  But he didn't.  He was still in touch with them, and they knew how to make some money.  All he had to do was help move a little bit of meth around.  Maybe he could get that new Datsun pickup truck, and maybe his wife could buy clothes somewhere other than K-Mart.  Maybe he could redeem himself in her eyes.  He was tempted, and he fell.\n\n\nThis was the beginning of the end for him.\n\n\nI'm not sure if you know any meth connoisseurs, but as a rule of thumb you can't really be involved in the product \u2013 at the street level anyway \u2013 without having a nibble every now and then.  Meth users just don't hang out with, or tend to trust, non-meth users.  So, my dad began using.  Unfortunately, my dad developed an acquired taste for the stuff.  All the money that he had originally brought in as extra income, was now simply being used to feed his addiction.\n\n\nIt didn't take very long for the fighting to begin.  Don't assume my mom was a naive innocent in all of this.  She managed to stay clean , and she was never directly involved in any of my father's dealings, but she never tried to stop him.  She also didn't mind that extra cash flow... before it was all absorbed by his usage anyway.  By the time I was 4 the fighting was really bad.  I still remember the way my mom would scream at him, and brow-beat him.  He kind of deserved it after all.  I still remember how he began hitting her, to make her shut up.  He beat the shit out of her actually, quite a few times.\n\n\nAt this point in time my grandma started spending a lot of time with my brother and I.  She'd regularly pick us up.  Usually on her own, but sometimes my mom would tell her about some scary guys that had to come talk to my dad, and she didn't want us around for a few days.  In time my grandmother became more of a mom to me than my actual mother was.  She began reading to me, and I caught on quickly.  I was reading proficiently before kindergarten, and my favorite thing to read about was dinosaurs.  I'd memorize their names, and I'd draw them over and over.  Drawing dinosaurs was actually how I learned to draw in the first place.  I actually became somewhat of a dinosaur drawing prodigy among my family.  Everyone was quite impressed.\n\n\nMy grandma couldn't always be there for me though.  She still worked a full time job herself.  So I was often stuck in that house with my meth-head dad, and my screaming mom, and wailing baby brother.  Some nights were calm.  Some nights were terrifying.  Some nights my mom would play a little game where we slept under my bed for the night, so the monsters couldn't get us.  I knew who the monster was.  The monster was my dad.\n\n\nBack to 2011.  It's been about a month since my dad drove into the telephone pole, and I'm having breakfast at Denny's with my grandma.  We're talking about my dad.  The time he spent in prison.  The two wives he had after my mom left him.  We talk about his drinking problem.  She tells me about how he was such a charming, and tough, and handsome young man when she first met him.  How he opened up to her that one time about his childhood.\n\n\nShe tells me how sorry she is that my brother and I had to spend most of our childhoods without him, and how awful he was when we did live with him.  And she tells me how unsettling it was when I stopped caring about it all.  How I had become numb to it.\n\n\n*\"They'd be screaming at each other at the top of their lungs!\"* My Grandma said.  *\"He threatened to kill her!  Right in front of me!  Said he'd shoot her in the head if she left him.  And Joey, I felt so bad for you...  You'd just lay there underneath the coffee table while it was all going on.  I remember.  You'd just lay there and draw dinosaurs, like nothing was happening.\"*\n\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n\nSweet Jesus, my inbox!\n\n\nThank you for the gold strangers!\n\n\nI made that post right before going to bed last night and I just got off work.  I'll try to answer as many of your questions as I can tonight.  Some of the responses were really moving...

That session presented jaw-dropping numbers  from some of Britain\u2019s top modelers of infectious disease, who  predicted the deadly course of the coronavirus could quickly kill  hundreds of thousands in both the United Kingdom and the United States,  as surges of sick and dying patients overwhelmed hospitals and critical  care units. The new forecasts, by Neil Ferguson and his colleagues at  the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, were quickly endorsed by  Johnson\u2019s government to design new and more extreme measures to suppress  the spread of the virus.\n\nThe  report is also influencing planning by the Trump administration. Deborah  Birx, who serves as the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task  force, cited the British analysis at a news conference Monday, saying  her response team was especially focused on the report\u2019s conclusion that  an entire household should self-quarantine for 14 days if one of its  members is stricken by the virus. The Imperial College London group  reported that if nothing was done by governments and individuals and the  pandemic remained uncontrolled, 510,000 would die in Britain and  2.2\u2009million in the United States over the course of the outbreak. These  kinds of numbers are deeply concerning for countries with top-drawer  health-care systems. They are terrifying for less-developed countries,  global health experts say. If Britain and the United States pursued  more-ambitious measures to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, to  slow but not necessarily stop the epidemic over the coming few months,  they could reduce mortality by half, to 260,000 people in the United  Kingdom and 1.1\u2009million in the United States.

Finally, if the  British government quickly went all-out to suppress viral spread \u2014  aiming to reverse epidemic growth and reduce the case load to a low  level \u2014 then the number of dead in the country could drop to below  20,000. To do this, the researchers said, Britain would have to enforce  social distancing for the entire population, isolate all cases, demand  quarantines of entire households where anyone is sick, and close all  schools and universities \u2014 and do this not for weeks but for 12 to 18  months, until a vaccine is available. \n\n\u201cWe might  be living in a very different world for a year or more,\u201d Ferguson told  reporters. The modelers did not give numbers for the United States for  the most intense suppression efforts. The researchers reminded  governments that these forecasts are based on current observed trends in  China, South Korea, Britain and Italy but that much remains unknown  about the virus. The Imperial College report, which was shared with the  British government over the weekend ahead of its official release  Monday, was responsible in large part for Johnson\u2019s turnaround decision  to begin rolling out what 10 Downing Street described as life-altering,  \u201cdrastic\u201d measures to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, aides  said. Johnson said the virus \u201cwould overwhelm any health system in the  world\u201d if quarantines and limits on social contact are not taken.  \u201cAlthough the measures we have already announced are extreme, we may  have to go further in the coming days,\u201d the prime minister said Tuesday.\n\nJohnson  urged his fellow citizens to immediately start to avoid \u201call  nonessential contact with others,\u201d work from home and self- isolate now  if they are elderly or suffer from underlying medical conditions. The  measures are still voluntary, but Johnson warned that his government had  the power to make them mandatory. Boris Johnson: 'Many more families  are going to lose loved ones' to coronavirus\n\nBritish  Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on March 12 that the \"most  dangerous period\" of the coronavirus was \"some weeks away\" for Britain.  (Reuters) Johnson said that healthy and asymptomatic Britons should  avoid pubs, clubs and theaters. In London, the bars were still open  Monday. Most schools, museums and restaurants were, too. But the prime  minister said closing schools was \u201cunder consideration.\u201d Roy Anderson,  an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College, who was not a part  of the study, said Britain probably had much more to do. \u201cI don\u2019t know  if these measures are enough yet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wish we had done them  last week.\u201d\n\nIf Britain had  continued on the go-slow, step-by-step course that it set just days ago,  the Imperial College modeling envisioned hundreds of thousands of  deaths and a tidal wave of cases that would overwhelm the National  Health Service and its hospitals. There are currently 7,000 ventilators  available for all of England, the largest nation within the United  Kingdom, with a population of 56\u2009million. The British forecast also  influenced thinking at the White House. On Monday evening in Washington,  President Trump said that Americans should avoid gathering in groups of  more than 10 people, eating in restaurants or taking nonessential trips  \u2014 his most significant push yet to combat a viral outbreak. At a news  conference Monday at the White House, Birx said her group has been  working with modelers around the globe, including in Britain. President  Trump listens as Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response  coordinator, announces that the outbreak could last months and that  gatherings should be limited to 10 people, during a White House briefing  on March 16. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \u201cSo, we had new information coming  out from a model, and what had the biggest impact in the model is social  distancing, small groups, not going in public in large groups. But the  most important thing was if one person in the household became infected,  the whole household self-quarantined for 14 days. Because that stops  100\u2009percent of the transmission outside of the household,\u201d she said.\n\nTo  suppress spread in Britain, widespread school and university closings  might also be necessary, though Ferguson worried about its impact on  staffing at NHS hospitals, where as many as a third of nurses have  school-age children, the Guardian newspaper reported. In their forecast,  the modelers envision that strict measures over the coming months will  occasionally be loosened, but as soon as they are, viral spread could  come roaring back. \u201cThe major challenge of suppression is that this type  of intensive intervention package .\u2009.\u2009. will need to be maintained  until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more), given  that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions  are relaxed,\u201d the study concludes. \u201cIntermittent social distancing \u2014  triggered by trends in disease surveillance \u2014 may allow interventions to  be relaxed temporarily in relatively short time windows, but measures  will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound,\u201d the  research team said.

I watched families squeeze in next to other families to admire the outdoor mall\u2019s dancing fountain.\n\nThe mall wasn\u2019t exactly hopping, but I saw only the odd mask. I didn\u2019t notice anyone make an obvious effort to stand six feet away from anyone else. If social distancing was happening, it was too subtle for me.\n\nThe sun was out. Rain had yet to fall. Life in the time of coronavirus, I thought, didn\u2019t seem to have changed our habits so much.\n\nStill, as I stood just off to the side taking these scenes in, I felt an intense wave of loss and nostalgia. It was only later when I was at home on my own that I fully began to understood why.\n\nAt first I thought I was mourning the enforced separation from each other that we were just about to start experiencing. Then I realized I was mourning a togetherness already on the way out \u2014 from a long ago age before Amazon, before Netflix, before Postmates. Before giant flat-screen home TVs with surround sound, before virtual reality.\n\nWe are in the midst of a pandemic. People suddenly are falling sick. They are dying. We must practice social distancing now \u2014 for our own health, to protect the health of others and to fight to keep this coronavirus in check.\n\nBut haven\u2019t we been distancing ourselves from each other more and more for years? Isn\u2019t being apart becoming more and more our norm?\n\nI\u2019d started out thinking about how, in California, we\u2019re used to crises making us come together, not come apart. In the rubble, in the ash, we\u2019re used to crossing our own property lines and comfort zones and reaching out to anyone at all who needs help.\n\nBut then I realized that part of what\u2019s striking in the modern era of our earthquakes and fires and mudslides is the many times when neighbors who were strangers meet each other in extremis, when in calamity communities suddenly spring to life and coalesce.\n\nBecause in the modern age, in ordinary circumstances, a lot of us increasingly keep to ourselves. After all, it\u2019s become so very easy and convenient.\n\nWhy go to a restaurant when you can have exactly what you would have ordered there delivered to you in the comfort of your home? Why go to a theater when you can watch a movie that\u2019s practically just come out on TV?\n\nWhy go see a friend when you can Facetime and text? Why go to the store and see people \u2014 except for pandemic panic shopping \u2014 when you have Amazon and Instacart? Why work in an office with others when you can do your job on your own in your pajamas?\n\nThe day after I went out in search of crowds, the rain arrived here in Los Angeles \u2014 literally and figuratively.\n\nSouthern California grew gray and damp. Coronavirus closed in.\n\nEvents that draw crowds started being canceled right and left. So did plenty of far cozier, more intimate gatherings. Concerts, conferences, festivals, tournaments, classes, church services, campaign rallies \u2014 all nixed, postponed or preparing to become online only.\n\nEverything changed in a flash, dictated by necessity. Social distance was no longer theoretical, isolation no longer optional.\n\nI\u2019ve written before about my worries about a modern-day world in which more and more people are isolated and lonely, working at jobs without offices, going whole days without real human contact. Now we\u2019re all in that boat.\n\nI\u2019m hoping enforced separation will do the trick and slow down the community spread of coronavirus. I\u2019m willing to do anything to help make that happen. I think we all have to be all in to do that.\n\nStill, many things I often chose to do immediately felt different and constricting when they were no longer by choice.\n\nAll our modern conveniences \u2014 our screens and our apps, our online shopping, our delivery services \u2014 can provide us with so much coziness and ease when we\u2019re feeling overstimulated and worn out and need to retreat from the big world outside.\n\nBut it\u2019s one thing to work from home because you feel like it and you can. It\u2019s another to be told that you cannot go spend the day with your co-workers in the office. It\u2019s one thing to stream a movie by choice or to choose to watch a basketball game on TV. It\u2019s another to be told that you should not go to a movie theater, that you can\u2019t go to a basketball game, that concerts have been called off.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to order in food because you want to put on your comfy clothes and curl up on the couch. It\u2019s another thing to get a note from one of the delivery apps saying you can now request not to even see your delivery person but to have your order left at the front door.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to know you can choose the big world anytime, when you\u2019re tired of the couch and of texting.\n\nRight now, of course, just a few days in, I want nothing more than to go out to eat with friends, to hug a neighbor, to hold a hand.\n\nI\u2019m hoping we get to the other side of this without large-scale tragedy. There\u2019s no way of knowing yet if we will.\n\nBut if we do, I\u2019m hoping that the experience of social distancing gives us pause and makes us realize how much we have missed company, not just the company of those we know and love but of strangers.\n\nWe live in a world that can be scary, a world where people fire into crowds, where stock markets crash, where the gap between the haves and the have-nots keeps growing, along with the anger and division. But I\u2019m hoping that if we get through this, we don\u2019t let fear take over, that we come together again in full appreciation of how good that can feel.\n\nJust the other day, I watched people mingling en masse.

I think the biggest concern here is just that coronavirus have a lot of inherent traits that you really don't want in a human virus that also carries significant illness or lethality.\n\nIt really does all work in the sense that one person can infect the entire planet and it's rarely the person's fault so much as you're looking at an impressive virus. \n\nSome of the other scary features of corona viruses in general MIGHT be: short-lived antibodies, less chance of cross strain resistance, capacity to jump between humans and animals, high mutation rate.  I think the whole class of RNA virus is just scary because it is super efficient and can mutate and recombine so it's just like really adaptable. Looking at modern medicine I guess we are having the most trouble with the RNA virus still. \n\nThat's really why it was worth trying to mass quarantine and eradicate the virus as much as possible though I don't think we're going to hit that target. However we might contain and slow it down long enough to develop a solid variety of treatments against it and eventually a vaccine. It also reminds us mutate and go away or something like that. It COULD happen and we're talking about possibilities so it's always worth to mention it. \n\nThe biggest threat, by far, is to the developing world, especially countries that have limited technology and industry.

Remove Malaria from Mosquitos\n\nResearchers\u00a0created [mosquitos that are resistant to the parasite that causes malaria](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a18324/crispr-gene-editing-used-to-make-malaria-resistant-mosquitoes/), *Plasmodium falciparum.*\u00a0They used CRISPR to remove a segment of mosquito DNA, and when the mosquitos' genetic system tried to repair the genome, it was tricked into replacing it with a DNA construct engineered by the scientists. Two genes in the construct make the mosquitos resistant to *Plasmodium falciparum*. The altered mosquitos passed on the resistance genes to 99 percent of their offspring, even when they mated with normal mosquitos. Good news for beating back a horrible disease.\n\n#### 2. Eliminate a Patient's Cancer\n\nThis medical marvel actually wasn't achieved using CRISPR, but using a similar gene-editing tool called TALEN. An infant girl had lymphoblastic leukemia, a serious form of blood cancer. After trying traditional cancer-treating methods such as chemotherapy and bone-marrow transplants, the doctors decided to [use gene-editing technologies in a last-ditch effort to save the girl](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/news/a18099/gene-editing-eliminate-cancer/). By altering the immune system T-cells of a donor to more effectively locate and kill leukemia cells without attacking the girl's body, doctors successfully eliminated her\u00a0cancer.\n\n#### 3. Treat Muscular Dystrophy\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation\u00a0that prevents\u00a0the body\u00a0from producing the dystrophin protein, a critical protein in the development of muscle tissue. People who have this genetic mutation suffer from muscle degeneration that is ultimately fatal. Because the mutation that causes muscular dystrophy affects one specific gene, the disease is [a prime target for\u00a0using CRISPR/Cas9](http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/gene-editing-shows-promise-in-treating-muscular-dystrophy/). Researchers successfully treated muscular dystrophy in lab mice this month by using CRISPR to cut and repair the dystrophin gene.\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\n#### 4. Make Hulked-Out Goats and Dogs\n\nChinese scientists have used CRISPR/Cas9 to [delete genes that inhibit muscle and hair growth](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a18225/china-crispr-gene-editing-creates-hulked-out-goats-and-dogs/) in goats to supplement the country's\u00a0commercial meat and wool industries. They also did the same to a couple of beagles,\u00a0for\u00a0reasons that are not quite clear. China is aggressively researching both genetic engineering and cloning, and it's possible that these two technologies become a common method of expanding livestock and agricultural industries. Huge delicious cows that don't get sick rolling out of the [cloning factory](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a18373/chinese-scientist-discusses-human-cloning/)? It could happen.\n\n#### 5. Give Pig Organs to Humans\n\nGeorge Church of the Harvard Medical School recently led a team of scientists that used a complex CRISPR molecule to\u00a0[edit\u00a062 genes in pig cells at once](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/science/editing-of-pig-dna-may-lead-to-more-organs-for-people.html?_r=1). Church believes that this technique could\u00a0be used to make pig organs suitable for transplantation into humans. The\u00a0team's experiments also represent a step forward in CRISPR technology by using the tool to edit many genes at once, a method that could be\u00a0imitated\u00a0to make more complicated changes to DNA quickly.\u00a0\n\n#### 6. Treat HIV\n\nHIV\u00a0inserts its DNA into the genome of the host, and while it can lay dormant for years and certain drug cocktails can keep it in check, there is no way to make the virus permanently inactive. Researchers have demonstrated that [CRISPR can be used to remove the virus's DNA from the patient's genome](http://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2015/04/editing-hiv-out-of-our-genome-with-crispr/). The big problem is that\u00a0it is difficult to locate HIV DNA in latent cells that don't demonstrate any of the\u00a0symptoms associated with the active virus. More detailed models of latently infected cells are\u00a0being developed in an attempt to find genetic sequences that could be cut out of the\u00a0virus to render it harmless.\n\n#### 7. Develop New Kinds\u00a0of Drugs\n\nDrug companies are eager to invent new ways to deliver the CRISPR gene-editing system to different parts of the body. Pharmaceutical giant [Bayer AG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer) and startup [CRISPR Therapeutics](http://crisprtx.com/news-events/news-events-press-releases-2015-12-21.php)recently announced a $300 million joint venture [to develop CRISPR-based drugs ](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545366/big-pharma-doubles-down-on-crispr-for-new-drugs/)to treat heart disease, blood disorders, and blindness. The partnership represents not an impending cure for any one disease, but\u00a0the beginning of a significant and aggressive period of research that they hope could lead to many.\n\n#### 8. Make Super Plants\n\nHumans have been improving the yield and disease resistance of crops for hundreds of years through traditional agricultural methods. But now researchers are experimenting with ways to improve crop disease resistance and environmental stress tolerance using CRISPR. A research team from [Rutgers is working on a long-term project to genetically modify wine grapes and turfgrass](http://portal.nifa.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/1005372-improvement-of-crop-disease-resistance-and-stress-tolerance-by-crisprcas-gene-editing.html) in such a way that the methods can be\u00a0implemented\u00a0in\u00a0a variety of other crops. The grapes will be edited to resist downy mildew, and a type of grass commonly found on golf courses called creeping bentgrass will be modified to resist dollar spot disease, a problem that is usually combated with fungicides. If successful, scientists could develop new, heartier crops to supplement the agricultural industry.\n\n#### 9. Engineer Mini-Pigs\n\nIn another example of gene-editing using the tool TALEN, [Chinese researchers created a particularly small variety of the Bama pig](http://www.nature.com/news/gene-edited-micropigs-to-be-sold-as-pets-at-chinese-institute-1.18448) by disabling one of the growth hormone receptor genes within the pig's fetal cells. The little pigs will reach about 30 pounds when full-grown. The researchers plan to sell the \"micropigs\" as pets.\n\n#### 10. Treat Blindness\n\nThere are a few efforts to use CRISPR to treat or even cure blindness in humans. Researchers have successfully [removed a genetic mutation from mice that causes retinitis pigmentosa](http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-gene-technique-vision-rats-inherited.html), a disease that ultimately leads to blindness. After a single injection of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, the rats were able to see better than a control group. Plans to [use a similar technique on humans](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/543181/crispr-gene-editing-to-be-tested-on-people-by-2017-says-editas/) are already underway. Biotechnology company Editas Medicine is planning to use CRISPR to treat the inherited eye disease leber's congenitial amaurosis (LCA) by 2017.\n\n#### 11. Edit Humans\n\nGene-editing techniques have already been used on humans, as is the case with the infant girl who was treated for leukemia with engineered T-cells. But scientists aren't likely to stop there. Researchers at the Francis Crick Institute in London want to [genetically modify human embryos ](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35301238)to learn more about the earliest stages of human life and potentially reduce the number of miscarriages. Experiment proposals like this one make some people\u00a0worry that genetic engineering technologies will be used in the future to create \"designer babies\" with preferred traits. We are a far cry from that kind of experimentation, but it won't be long before gene-editing is used to combat diseases and other ailments.", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "created_utc": 1533241724, "id": "e3humgq", "author": "nikishkas", "link_id": "t3_942v2j", "parent_id": "t3_942v2j", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": true, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "And Biden said he'll veto M4A based off the cost, completely flying in the face of the current research.

Efforts are ongoing to repeal the Affordable Care Act which would exacerbate health-care inequities. By contrast, a universal system, such as that proposed in the Medicare for All Act, has the potential to transform the availability and efficiency of American health-care services. Taking into account both the costs of coverage expansion and the savings that would be achieved through the Medicare for All Act, **we calculate that a single-payer, universal health-care system is likely to lead to a 13% savings in national health-care expenditure, equivalent to more than US$450 billion annually (based on the value of the US$ in 2017).** The entire system could be funded with less financial outlay than is incurred by employers and households paying for health-care premiums combined with existing government allocations. This shift to single-payer health care would provide the greatest relief to lower-income households. **Furthermore, we estimate that ensuring health-care access for all Americans would save more than 68\u2008000 lives and 1\u00b773 million life-years every year compared with the status quo.** \n\n [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext#articleInformation](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext#articleInformation) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n68,000 lives a year.

Most types of female circumcision only involve cutting the clitoral hood away, or even pricking the clitoris with a needle to draw blood. All those are illegal in the west. I am not for any type of female circumcision, but the west seems to think there is only one kind and they all are the same. \n\nAnd male circumcision does a hell of a lot more than remove a couple centimeters of skin. Here are some things it removes:\n\n1. Frenar Band, or Ridged Band\nThe frenar band is a group of soft ridges near the junction of the inner and outer foreskin. This region is the primary erogenous zone of the intact male body. Loss of this delicate belt of densely innervated, sexually responsive tissue reduces the fullness and intensity of sexual response. [Source: Taylor, J. R. et al., \"The Prepuce: Specialized Mucosa of the Penis and Its Loss to Circumcision,\" British Journal of Urology 77 (1996): 291-295.]\n\n2. Mechanical Gliding Action\nThe foreskin's gliding action is a hallmark feature of the normal, natural, intact penis. This non-abrasive gliding of the penis in and out of its own shaft skin facilitates smooth, comfortable, pleasurable intercourse for both partners. Without this gliding action, the corona of the circumcised penis can function as a one-way valve, making artificial lubricants necessary for comfortable intercourse. [Source: P. M. Fleiss, MD, MPH, \"The Case Against Circumcision,\" Mothering: The Magazine of Natural Family Living (Winter 1997): 36-45.]\n\n3. Meissner's Corpuscles\nCircumcision removes the most important sensory component of the foreskin - thousands of coiled fine-touch receptors called Meissner's corpuscles. Also lost are branches of the dorsal nerve, and between 10,000 and 20,000 specialized erotogenic nerve endings of several types. Together these detect subtle changes in motion and temperature, as well as fine gradations in texture. [Sources: 1. R. K.

Winkelmann, \"The Cutaneous Innervation of Human Newborn Prepuce,\" Journal of Investigative Dermatology 26 (1956): 53-67.]\n\n4. Frenulum\nThe frenulum is a highly erogenous V-shaped structure on the underside of the glans that tethers the foreskin. During circumcision it is frequently either amputated with the foreskin or severed, which destroys or diminishes its sexual and physiological functions. [Sources: 1. Cold, C, Taylor, J, \"The Prepuce,\" BJU International 83, Suppl. 1, (1999): 34-44. 2. Kaplan, G.W., \"Complications of Circumcision,\" Urologic Clinics of North America 10, 1983.]\n\n5. Dartos Fascia\nCircumcision removes approximately half of this temperature-sensitive smooth muscle sheath which lies between the outer layer of skin and the corpus cavernosa. [Source: Netter, F.H., \"Atlas of Human Anatomy,\" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): Plates 234, 329, 338, 354, 355.]\n\n6. Immunological System\nThe soft mucosa (inner foreskin) contains its own immunological defense system which produces plasma cells. These cells secrete immunoglobulin antibodies as well as antibacterial and antiviral proteins, including the pathogen killing enzyme lysozyme. [Sources: 1. A. Ahmed and A. W. Jones, \"Apocrine Cystadenoma: A Report of Two Cases Occurring on the Prepuce,\" British Journal of Dermatology 81 (1969): 899-901. 2. P. J. Flower et al., \"An Immunopathologic Study of the Bovine Prepuce,\" Veterinary Pathology 20 (1983):189-202.]\n\n7. Lymphatic Vessels\nThe loss of these vessels due to circumcision reduces the lymph flow within that part of the body's immune system. [Source: Netter, F.H., \"Atlas of Human Anatomy,\" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): plate 379.]\n\n8. Estrogen Receptors\nThe presence of estrogen receptors within the foreskin has only recently been discovered. Their purpose is not yet understood and needs further study. [Source: R. Hausmann et al., \"The Forensic Value of the Immunohistochemical Detection of Oestrogen Receptors in Vaginal Epithelium,\" International Journal of Legal Medicine 109 (1996): 10-30.]\n\n9. Apocrine Glands\nThese glands of the inner foreskin produce pheromones - nature's powerful, silent, invisible behavioral signals to potential sexual partners. The effect of their absence on human sexuality has never been studied. [Source: A. Ahmed and A. W. Jones, \"Apocrine Cystadenoma: A Report of Two Cases Occurring on the Prepuce,\" British Journal of Dermatology 81 (1969): 899-901.]\n\n10. Sebaceous Glands\nThe sebaceous glands may lubricate and moisturize the foreskin and glans, which is normally a protected internal organ. Not all men have sebaceous glands on their inner foreskin. [Source: A. B. Hyman and M. H. Brownstein, \"Tyson's Glands: Ectopic Sebaceous Glands and Papillomatosis Penis,\" Archives of Dermatology 99 (1969): 31-37.]\n\n11.

Weiss et al., \"The Distribution and Density of Langerhans Cells in the Human Prepuce: Site of a Diminished Immune Response?\" Israel Journal of Medical Sciences 29 (1993): 42-43.]\n\n12. Natural Glans Coloration\nThe natural coloration of the glans and inner foreskin (usually hidden and only visible to others when sexually aroused) is considerably more intense than the permanently exposed and keratinized coloration of a circumcised penis. The socio-biological function of this visual stimulus has never been studied.\nThe glans ranges from pink to red to dark purple among intact men of Northern European ancestry, and from pinkish to mahagony to dark brown among intact men of Color. If circumcision is performed on an infant or young boy, the connective tissue which protectively fuses the foreskin and glans together is ripped apart. This leaves the glans raw and subject to infection, scarring, pitting, shrinkage, and eventual discoloration. Over a period of years the glans becomes keratinized, adding additional layers of tissue in order to adequately protect itself, which further contributes to discoloration. Many restoring men report dramatic changes in glans color and appearance, and that these changes closely mirror the natural coloration and smooth, glossy appearance of the glans seen in intact men.\n[Source: P. M. Fleiss, MD, MPH, \"The Case Against Circumcision,\" Mothering: The Magazine of Natural Family Living (Winter 1997): 36-45.]\n\n13. Length and Circumference\nCircumcision removes some of the length and girth of the penis - its double-layered wrapping of loose and usually overhanging foreskin is removed. A circumcised penis is truncated and thinner than it would have been if left intact. [Source: R. D. Talarico and J. E. Jasaitis, \"Concealed Penis: A Complication of Neonatal Circumcision,\" Journal of Urology 110 (1973): 732-733.]\n\n14. Blood Vessels\nSeveral feet of blood vessels, including the frenular artery and branches of the dorsal artery, are removed in circumcision. The loss of this rich vascularization interrupts normal blood flow to the shaft and glans of the penis, damaging the natural function of the penis and altering its development. [Sources: 1. H. C. Bazett et al., \"Depth, Distribution and Probable Identification in the Prepuce of Sensory End-Organs Concerned in Sensations of Temperature and Touch; Thermometric Conductivity,\" Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry 27 (1932): 489-517. 2. Netter, F.H., \"Atlas of Human Anatomy,\" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): plates 238, 239.]\n\n15. Dorsal Nerves\nThe terminal branch of the pudendal nerve connects to the skin of the penis, the prepuce, the corpora cavernosa, and the glans. Destruction of these nerves is a rare but devastating complication of circumcision. If cut during circumcision, the top two-thirds of the penis will be almost completely without sensation. [Sources: 1. Agur, A.M.R. ed., \"Grant's Atlas of Anatomy,\" Ninth Edition (Williams and Wilkins, 1991): 188-190. 2. Netter, F.H., \"Atlas of Human Anatomy,\" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): plate 380, 387.]\n\n16+ Other Losses\n- Circumcision performed during infancy disrupts the bonding process between child and mother. There are indications that the innate sense of trust in intimate human contact is inhibited or lost. It can also have significant adverse effects on neurological development.\n-Additionally, an infant's self-confidence and hardiness is diminished by forcing the newborn victim into a defensive psychological state of \"learned helplessness\" or \"acquired passivity\" to cope with the excruciating pain which he can neither fight nor flee.\n- The trauma of this early pain lowers a circumcised boy's pain threshold below that of intact boys and girls. This has been proven in a study during vaccination time. [Sources: 1. R. Goldman, Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma (Boston: Vanguard Publications, 1997), 139-175. 2. A. Taddio et al., \"Effect of Neonatal Circumcision on Pain Responses during Vaccination in Boys,\" Lancet 345 (1995): 291-292.]\n- Every year some boys lose their entire penises from circumcision accidents and infections. They are then \"sexually reassigned\" by castration and transgender surgery, and are expected to live their lives as females. [Sources: 1. J. P. Gearhart and J. A.

If you have ANY integrity whatsoever, look at the actual data and then try to tell me that masks don't reduce the risk of infection:\n\n[National Institutes of Health](http://archive.is/5Vm12) - Home-made cloth masks reduce permeation even of tiny 0.02 \u00b5m\u20131 \u00b5m particles by 50%, with surgical masks reducing permeation by 75% even during real-world activities.  Considering that droplet transmission viruses (like the one causing COVID19) often require larger droplets than that, these masks could be even more effective against this particular virus.\n\nQuote:\n&gt; Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection.\n\n---\n\n[International Journal of Infectious Diseases](http://archive.is/1Mwcb) - This one shows surgical masks preventing the wearer from being infected when living with someone who has the flu.\n\nQuote:\n&gt; We found compliance to be low, but compliance is affected by perception of risk. In a pandemic, we would expect compliance to improve. In compliant users, masks were highly efficacious.\n\n---\n\n[Journal of the American Medical Association](http://archive.is/cvUQ7) - This study of 446 nurses in Ontario hospitals showed that n95 masks and surgical masks offered similar protection from viral infection for the wearer.\n\nQuote:\n&gt; Our data show that the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was similar in nurses wearing the surgical mask and those wearing the N95 respirator. Surgical masks had an estimated efficacy within 1% of N95 respirators.\n\n---\n\n[National Institutes of Health](http://archive.is/GMOaG) - Surgical masks offer almost as effective filtration efficiency against simulated particles as n95 masks.\n\nQuote:\n&gt; The in-vivo filtration tests illustrated that N95 respirators filtered out 97% of potassium chloride (KCl) solution, while surgical masks filtered out 95% of KCl solution.\n\n---\n\nAnd for the coup de gr\u00e2ce, here's one published in [Emerging Infectious Diseases](http://archive.is/spCh6) (the journal of the CDC) with a juicy quote:\n\n&gt; We present the results of a prospective clinical trial of face mask use conducted in response to an urgent need to clarify the clinical benefit of using masks. The key findings are that &lt;50% of participants were adherent with mask use and that the intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference between arms. Although our study suggests that community use of face masks is unlikely to be an effective control policy for seasonal respiratory diseases, **adherent mask users had a significant reduction in the risk for clinical infection**. Another recent study that examined the use of surgical masks and handwashing for the prevention of influenza transmission also found no significant difference between the intervention arms (12).\n\n&gt; Our study found that only 21% of household contacts in the face mask arms reported wearing the mask often or always during the follow-up period. Adherence with treatments and preventive measures is well known to vary depending on perception of risk (27) and would be expected to increase during an influenza pandemic. During the height of the SARS epidemic of April and May 2003 in Hong Kong, adherence to infection control measures was high; 76% of the population wore a face mask, 65% washed their hands after relevant contact, and 78% covered their mouths when sneezing or coughing (28). In addition, adherence may vary depending on cultural context; Asian cultures are more accepting of mask use (29). Therefore, although we found that distributing masks during seasonal winter influenza outbreaks is an ineffective control measure characterized by low adherence, **results indicate the potential efficacy of masks in contexts where a larger adherence may be expected, such as during a severe influenza pandemic or other emerging infection.**", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1584071333, "id": "fkd8s7q", "author": "Sattorin", "link_id": "t3_fhtddc", "parent_id": "t3_fhtddc", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "This is an unfair characterization of my community, and similar communities.

I grew up with pediatric phimosis and it had \"stunted\" my growth.  When I was very young, I had no idea as there was no pain and I had no indication that anything was wrong.  But when I reached my teenage years, when I started to get erections, it was preventing my penis (whom I will refer to as General Zod from now on) to get to full length.  It was stopping it just around 4 1/2 inches, but the pain would gradually get worse as I got older. \n\nFinally when I was 20, I couldn't take it anymore, and I went to see a urologist who recommended a circumcision.  He said that the procedure would only take an hour or so and that my recovery would take a few weeks.  When I asked about the pain, he said that I will feel some pain, but he will prescribe some pain-killers and topical steroids for the glans.\n\nHe didn't, however, take into account that General Zod was never allowed to get to full length.  So when he stitched the General up, he stitched it up so that the it would be around 5 inches again; Zod is really just under 7 inches.  Over the next few weeks I couldn't move out of bed, I couldn't wear clothes, and I was constantly covering myself in bacitracin. \n\nNow originally the only thing holding General Zod back was the glans; now it was just a few stitches.

On the same day, another patient from the center, a woman in her 80s, died at her family home. Both of their deaths have now been attributed to the coronavirus.\n\n&gt;The ire of the relatives of those inside was growing with each new revelation.\n\n&gt;\u201cBecause these are elderly and infirm people, it\u2019s like we are waiting for them to be picked off, one by one,\u201d said Kevin Connolly, whose 81-year-old father-in-law, Jerry Wall, has been at Life Care for about a year, recovering from heart and kidney failure.\n\n&gt;Mr. Connolly said about 65 families with relatives in the facility have been in touch after Life Care emailed the families a generic update yesterday but left their email addresses visible. \u201cEverybody on that thread started sharing their stories,\u201d said Jodi Connolly, who said that her father\u2019s regular nurse was not working and that he had not been told why.\n\n&gt;\u201cThey are prisoners with no information in there,\u201d she said.\nThe news that two people from the center died of coronavirus days before officials identified the emerging crisis suggested that the virus had been circulating inside the facility even longer than had been understood. That means it may have been a threat to visitors, workers and residents for days, widening the circle of people who may be at risk.\n\n&gt;Nowhere else in the country has been known to have been hit as hard by the virus as Kirkland.\n\n&gt;Seven residents of the Life Care center were dead from the virus, and seven other people with connections to the home had been sickened by it. One visitor to the center apparently traveled home to North Carolina before testing positive for the virus, an outcome North Carolina officials announced on Tuesday.\n\n&gt;Dr. Chris Spitters, the health officer in Snohomish County, north of Seattle, said resources have become stretched in a way that limits how much officials can focus on any one case\n\u201cReally, we\u2019re kind of having to triage our efforts,\u201d he said.\n\n&gt;Across Washington State, nine people have died, the only deaths in the United States in a coronavirus crisis that has killed 3,000 people worldwide. State officials also announced that several more people have been sickened, including two people in their 20s who were hospitalized in the Seattle suburb of Issaquah. On Tuesday, Amazon told employees via email that a worker in one of its many office buildings in Seattle\u2019s South Lake Union neighborhood had tested positive for the virus.\n\n&gt;Dr. Manisha Juthani, an associate professor at Yale School of Medicine who studies infectious diseases in older populations, said it was sad but not unexpected that the virus had reached a nursing facility and, once there, caused multiple deaths.\n\n&gt;\u201cAre we going to see this again in other facilities?\u201d Dr. Juthani said. \u201cUnfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we do.\u201d\n\n&gt;In Kirkland, a quarter of the city\u2019s firefighters and a few police officers have been asked to isolate themselves after they visited the nursing center. A dozen of them had flulike symptoms, an official said.\nFamilies of the nursing facility residents were growing increasingly anxious as residents continued to be kept inside the center, and visits were not allowed.\n\n&gt;\u201cI went from not worrying much to being really worried now,\u201d said Debbie Delosangeles, who said in an interview with The New York Times on Monday that she had been told that her 85-year-old mother had been symptom free. On Tuesday, she learned that her mother\u2019s health had declined. Workers told Ms. Delosangeles that they would treat her mother for her high fever but did not intend to test her for coronavirus unless she developed breathing problems.\n\n&gt;Bridget Parkhill said her 77-year-old mother had been sick inside the facility for nearly a week, and had a breathing issue for a short while, but had not been tested.\n\n&gt;\u201cMom found out today that a friend that would come see her all the time was in the hospital and not doing well,\u201d Ms. Parkhill said. She said she had visited the facility and walked around the exterior, to see her mother through a window.\n\n&gt;Officials at the Life Care center have said that they were following federal protocol and were doing the best they could given a chaotic situation. At Harborview Medical Center, where one person has died, officials were working to determine which staff members may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n.Officials in Washington State were rushing to take steps to contain the spread. Health officials were asking the State Legislature for an additional $100 million in funding to help respond to the virus. Some leaders were weighing widespread closings of events.\n\n&gt;Businesses, schools and houses of worship altered their practices. Amazon and Microsoft have turned events related to International Women\u2019s Day later this week into online meetings. The Archdiocese of Seattle indefinitely postponed an annual Mass and dance for people with disabilities that had been set for Saturday. And a baseball league for youths told parents that players would be discouraged from giving high-fives and handshakes.\n\n&gt;Officials from the Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday that they were closing a Seattle field office of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services after an employee visited the Kirkland nursing care facility and developed symptoms of illness. The employee had been going to work after the visit but before getting sick.\n\n&gt;Dr. Spitters, the health officer in Snohomish County, said officials may get to a point where they need to limit public gatherings, such as high school basketball games and conventions.\n\n&gt;\u201cThese things could end up becoming temporarily discouraged, if not prohibited,\u201d Dr. Spitters said.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583364358, "id": "fjibxl3", "author": "skeebidybop", "link_id": "t3_fdlsfn", "parent_id": "t3_fdlsfn", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "whatever the gov do, the extremists over there will use ANY reasoning possible to convince the poor religious sheeps to go against the government.

The total infection rate will prove far more important than the mortality rate when it comes to total deaths because you only got lucky that SARS didn't establish itself as a constantly seasonal virus.\n\nYou have more total infected people from this virus in only a few days than total from SARS. I wouldn't compare the experience with SARS to this at all, it's much worse if only through bad luck, but probably because this corona virus is significantly easier to spread and it may have started in a more populated epicenter, not sure on that part.\n\nIn any case it's moving much much faster than SARS and the big threat isn't a one time outbreak like SARS it's a high liklyhood it will become a season and recorruing virus with little to no chance of developing lasting immunity.\n\nWith a coronavirus you will often be able to get the same strain on only a few months, so it's very important that not too many people ever get infected at one time over too large of an area or it won't just be like the flu, it's ill be like an additional flu that comes back every year and is significantly harder to be resistant against through any form of antibody treatment.\n\nThe world does not have an existing mature coronavirus vaccine infrastructure, they don't know what's going to work and be safe like they kind of do with the flu.

Would you like poor people to be able to get tested for coronavirus or other infectious diseases that may spring up in the future? Would you like them to be willing to adhere to a quarantine, even if their boss is threatening to fire them unless they come in sick?\n\nAnother significant advantage of this is that it gives people more freedom to try risky endeavors, like setting up their own small businesses. It takes away the risk of the owner dying if the company fails, and also gets rid of the need for employer-provided health insurance policies which makes the process much easier, and could lead to significant economic growth.\n\n&gt;$15 minimum wage is just going to get people fired and hours reduced.\n\nLook up research on the effects of increasing minimum wage. While decreases in employment or hours worked have been seen in some cases, increases have also been seen, and on average the research has found close to no impact on employment.\n\nAside from that, the overall economic gains would be significant. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. Working 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, you only make $15,080 per year. That leaves you at just under 125% of the poverty line and allows you to claim food stamps, medicaid, and likely housing assistance as well, but only if you stay poor. Effectively, it's a set of substantial government subsidies for employers who pay their employees poorly, as well as creating a welfare trap where any small increase in pay would likely have a negative impact on the financial status of the employees. If we make the minimum wage $15/hour, almost anyone working at minimum wage could afford to get a small raise or a promotion, and suddenly they have an incentive to work harder and do their jobs better.\n\n&gt;Then federal jobs guarantee? You really want the government to be in charge of providing jobs?\n\nThe government provides jobs already. Having the government give money to people for doing important and useful things doesn't seem terribly unreasonable.\n\n&gt;Yang's freedom dividend is (was) the only real solution to capitalism run amok. Give all americans straight up cash. That's how you redistribute wealth. No government programs or gimmicks. If you want to reduce income inequality, just give people money.\n\nYes, universal basic income would be a good thing to implement. It's already being tested out in a small scale in [several pilot studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_pilots) and the results are promising so far. Andrew Yang probably wasn't the right person to try to champion that though, since he's never previously held an elected office.

Each one is a person talking on a webcam on what appears to be their living room PC. \n\nThe first one is a woman, nodding her head along with christian music. She starts singing along. After a couple songs she turns the music volume down and begins addressing the camera. She talks about how she runs a religious organization and is an expert in the end times. Then she dives into how this pandemic is a sign that the Book of Revelations is starting to happen. After about 30 minutes I gave up. But her website is openyoureyespeople.com\n\nThe third guy gets right to talking. He also is screen capturing so we can see his computer. He has a Chrome open with many tabs. First he has a NBC news article about coronavirus and highlights portions of it and reads them. Then he goes to a google doc he prepared thats full of images. He points to a satellite image of Vatican City and says \"the vatican is in the shape of a pregnant serpent wearing a crown. Corona is spanish for crown. This is proof the end times are upon us\". He then shows two images of some religious altar that is supposedly in the vatican. He turns them upside down and draws the shape of genitalia on them (one male one female) and says this hidden imagery is more proof of coronavirus in christian prophecy. He starts talking about how the virus is part of a bigger plan to bring about the (((new world order))). At this point I had to stop. He also had a website that looked like it was made in the 90s, I can't remember it or his name but I am re checking for that right now.\n\nEDIT: the guy is Jonathan Kleck at jonathankleck.com he's also on youtube.

The authors of *this* paper argue that the mutations that differentiate the two types may not be all that significant.\n\n&gt; An analysis of genetic data from the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak was recently published in the journal National Science Review by Tang et al. (2020) 36. Two of the key claims made by this paper appear to have been reached by misunderstanding and over-interpretation of the SARS-CoV-2 data, with an additional analysis suffering from methodological limitations....\n\n&gt; One nonsynonymous mutation which has not been assessed for functional significance is not sufficient to define a distinct \u201ctype\u201d nor \u201cmajor type\u201d.

(It\u2019s up to you to believe their stories and excuses) it\u2019s CNY and they didn\u2019t go back, it\u2019s quite a tough sell imo.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And they were walking around as if there was nothing wrong and spreading viruses not even wearing a mask  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I\u2019m sorry if the reality on the ground is tough to swallow guys but this IS the truth /s\n\nmust all chinese nationals go back to China/HK for CNY?! whats wrong if they dont go back, or what if they have uprooted their families and have relocated to SG already? i find this excessive paranoia over the top and incredibly irrational. this isnt the reality on the ground, this is you forcing YOUR version of perceived reality down their throats.\n\nBy your logic, places like HDL/SBS/coffee shops/hawker centres, who may heavily rely on china workers have to close down as well liao.

Yet, single viral particles are not viable nor do they have the ability to travel for significant distances. Viral particles spread in droplets, whether gross or fine. Even when a person sneezes a fine mist which remains airborne for some time, this mist is composed of droplets much larger than 125nm and containing many particles.\n\nThe masks are most definitely not useless, please do not spread this misinformation. As a thought experiment, supposing the masks are useless, how do you explain the fact that the virus is not freely spreading between all medical personnel and field epidemiologists?\n\nAlso, as I said before, this is not a binary question. A reduced but non-zero probability of contracting the virus with proper protection does not render the protection useless.\n\n&gt; Also if there are asymptomatic spreaders, that has been confirmed multiple times, you cannot contain it. You should test all the population every time. Testing samples is useless so either the government is utterly incompetent without understanding of basic math and virology or they just want to contain the panic making people believe that they are in control.\n\nI agree that containment is extremely unlikely, but containment is not the only useful goal. Reduction of rate of spread is the goal to aim for. Every delayed month, week or even day counts towards keeping the load on hospitals reasonable, reducing viral load in the population and buying time for treatments and vaccines to be tested.\n\nTherefore, once you accept that containment is not the goal, testing and aggressive contact tracing coupled with preventing as many infected people from freely roaming and infecting others remains useful for the goal of delaying spread as much as possible.\n\nThe tests are cheap enough that countries several orders of magnitude can afford them by the thousands and the US is simply failing in this regard.\n\n&gt; The cases with polmonite or respiratory problems are 20% of total infected population.

These stresses may also increase the challenges of getting updated messages and coordinating guidance to these jurisdictions directly.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;The plan, which was unclassified but marked \u201cFor Official Use Only // Not For Public Distribution or Release,\u201d was shared with The New York Times as Mr. Trump escalated his efforts to curb the spread of the virus. After weeks of playing down the seriousness of the pandemic, saying it would miraculously disappear, Mr. Trump began shifting to a more sober tone during a news conference on Friday announcing the national emergency.\n&gt;\n&gt;Much of the plan is bureaucratic in nature, describing coordination among agencies and actions that in some cases have already been taken, like urging schools to close and large events to be canceled. But its discussion of the Defense Production Act came as lawmakers and others urged Mr. Trump to invoke its powers.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cWhile the administration\u2019s response has so far lacked the urgency this crisis has called for, there are still steps you can take to mitigate the damage,\u201d Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump on Tuesday. \u201cInvoking the powers vested in the DPA will enable the federal government to step up and take the type of aggressive steps needed in this time of uncertainty.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;Another letter sent last week by 57 House Democrats led by Representative Andy Levin of Michigan made similar points: \u201cDuring World War II, our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers, tanks, and many smaller items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world. We know what the demands of this time are, and we must act now to meet these demands.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told him on Tuesday that the Pentagon would provide federal health workers with five million respirator masks and 2,000 specialized ventilators. \u201cThe American public is on wartime footing in terms of battling the spread of this disease, and the Pentagon has to be part of the effort to help protect the health and safety of the American people,\u201d Mr. Reed said.\n&gt;\n&gt;But Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he was not ready to invoke the Defense Production Act. \u201cWe\u2019re able to do that if we have to,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cRight now, we haven\u2019t had to, but it\u2019s certainly ready. If I want it, we can do it very quickly. We\u2019ve studied it very closely over two weeks ago, actually. We\u2019ll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it. We hope we don\u2019t need it. It\u2019s a big step.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;Passed in 1950 shortly after American troops went to war defending South Korea against an invasion from North Korea, the Defense Production Act was based on powers used during World War II and authorized the president to require businesses to prioritize and accept contracts necessary for national defense.\n&gt;\n&gt;Over the years, its scope has been expanded to include domestic preparedness and national emergencies. A president can make direct loans or loan guarantees and purchase commitments, subsidies or other incentives to influence industry to help in times of crisis.\n&gt;\n&gt;Other key decisions outlined as options for the president include distributing medical supplies and equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile, providing money to states to help them meet demands caused by the coronavirus outbreak and prioritizing the distribution of essential resources to focus on areas most in need.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cThe spread and severity of Covid-19 will be difficult to forecast and characterize,\u201d the government plan said.

And the evidence seems pretty clear that testing criteria have been far too restrictive. So I think we unfortunately probably won't have a great sense for how many cases have required serious treatment. I also think there's a real possibility that some early coronavirus deaths may not have been counted-- though that's just unqualified speculation. Finally, I think mortality rates will also vary based on access to supportive treatment. As the virus breaks out and local hospitals are overwhelmed, I would expect mortality rates to increase.

Rather than signing a treaty, they'd go home to each country and attempt to have the standards enacted into law through the normal legal process.  (And because there was no treaty, no formal obligations, Lou Dobbs sounded the nutbar clarion call about a *secret* treaty with claims about a North American Union.)\n\nOr they'd agree on and publish a list of who should contact who in the event of a virus outbreak that crosses borders.  (The document includes a single reference to the US, a single paragraph stating that the World Health Organization would be notified by fax, with a phone number they could call for more information.  The WorldNetDaily headline, linking to the document, [repeated](https://www.google.ca/#q=%22U.S.+UNDER+U.N.+LAW+IN+HEALTH+EMERGENCY%22) on countless conspiracy web sites, was \"U.S. UNDER U.N. LAW IN HEALTH EMERGENCY\", with a tale of how the government has agreed to martial law backed by U.N. troops.)\n\n&gt; The Beyond the Borders initiative will allow for the further integration of our economies and our security.\n\nAnd when in use our economies will still be **less** integrated than a decade ago.  The passport controls and other obstacles put on the border over the last decade will still be there, the border locked down even further.  That is a step **away** from an EU-style union with its transparent borders, not towards it.\n\n&gt; As for the Currency, the prospect is there and if it were to happen, I would expect it to be 40+ years away.  In that time both governments would have to make changes for it to be possible. \n\nThat's a realistic time frame for the US to get its deficit problem under control.  There will probably be two more crashes in that time like the 1980s Saving &amp; Loan scandal and later the institutionalized mortgage fraud turned institutionalized investment fraud.  So perhaps after one of them the US will decide not to leave the same fraudsters in charge of the economy.\n\nBut there are other problems that won't go away, like Canada wanting a lower currency to help exports.  And the Tyranny of the Majority, a problem in North America that the EU (with multiple large powers and many smaller ones that can band together) doesn't have.\n\nA more likely outcome would be a global currency that doesn't replace national ones but makes them less relevant.  (There's a whole genre of conspiracy theories there, with many misrepresentations of its own.)\n\n&gt; Canada is Signing the same free trade agreements as the United States is, reconciling them would not be a hard task. \n\n*Some* are the same.  We've signed several since the 2008 crash that the US isn't party to, including four non-EU countries in Europe.  And we don't have the US's job-killing near-free-trade with China.\n\nWe've recently signed a free trade agreement with the EU itself.  The US and EU are in preliminary talks, but it's a decade off.\n\nSuch treaties are NOT an EU-style union, with its transparent internal borders, common external tariff, common political and military structures, and worker mobility between countries.  Again, in North America we've moved **away** from these things over the last decade.\n\n&gt; With the decline of United States hegemony, regional hegemonies such as the EU will become more common with time. \n\nJust the opposite.  Look at the 2005 TPP, now being expanded to include countries on four continents.  Or the Canada-EU free trade agreement.  Or Canada's OTHER recent free trade agreements with countries in Europe, the middle east and South America, and the ones it's negotiating with India, Asia and elsewhere.

Not reconciling that thought with the reality that zero safety measures ^((since I knew similar non-efforts were being made at airports elsewhere)^) would result in it surely making its way over. But instead, I participated in events (while wearing my mask), and slowly acclimated to my classes at NYU. Two weeks went by. Nothing had changed in New York. Maybe it would all just pass? It simply wouldn't make it over here, at least seriously?\nComforted by these thoughts, I stopped wearing my mask as people became aggresive to me on the trains and elsewhere for wearing my mask.\n\nThen cases started popping up, and still for weeks I saw not even a poor response, but a NEGATIVE one from authorities, seemingly trying to encourage the spread of the virus (Dont wear masks, etc misinformation). March 9th on my way to class, I only saw 4 others wearing respirators and masks out of hundreds of people. *These people have no idea what is going to hit them*. I was bewildered. Not even most of the Chinese International students I saw near campus were wearing anything. I never could have imagined such weakness.\n\nIt's a shame there is no forethought and capacity not only in this administration, but in American and maybe western society in general. Anyone could have done the math, and many did if you look around on some forums and places, but by and large I'm sure most two-bit politicians and the general swaths of people in America weren't even aware of the shortage of ventilators that would cause unimaginable fatalities.\n\nHopefully something positive will come of this, and not just another Patriot Act, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\n\nOriginally praying that my suitemates wouldn't infect me from their cavalierness, I eventually found myself flying back to Shanghai. And after testing negative on landing regarding the Coronavirus, I then entered a mandatory 14 day quarantine at home. Yes, a quarantine despite testing negative, since postives are sent to hospitals directly, and 14 days is long enough to starve out false negatives. Efficient, and what's needed against such a new era pandemic.\n\nThe strength of strong regimes show in their ability to get things done, be it build a metro system (anywhere it wants, and right away!), or enact any other sort of sweeping laws with ease. Brute strength is not something ideologically applauded usually in western thought, but it turns out it's much more effective than any measures needing to wait for hesistant deliberation. Even if this wasn't Singapore, I witnessed more than ever before what benevelent actions from a dictatorship could accomplish. I left Shanghai when it had 200 some cases, it now has just under 400, and only 4 dead. There was no strain on ventilator capacity due to efficient measures that\u2014 while not as fast as they could have been\u2014 helped limit resource overwhelming to Wuhan and Hubei, and eventually helped stabilize those areas as well.

Then he pulled her shoes off, helped her figure out how to unfasten her denim skirt. \u201cThat\u2018s OK\u201c she slurred, when he began removing her bra., but it was off before she could offer any physical resistance. He guided her down onto her back, and then, by twisting her legs, forced her to roll onto her tummy. \n\nHooking his finger in the crotch band of the faded, pink thong, he tugged downward. \u201cNO!\u201d she said, grabbing the waistband with both hands. He kept pulling, and in an instant, the crotch band snapped. \n\nShe continued her drunken protestations as his hands slapped onto her springy asscheeks. He clutched and wiggled the rubbery mounds, rubbing them against each other. Then he spread them wide apart and eyed the tantalizing puckered ring of her anus. \"You've got a cute asshole, Wendy!\" \n\n\"Professor!\" Wendy gasped. She squirmed, wobbling her thin buttocks in his hands. \n\nRaymond bent close and spat, landing a large glob of saliva directly on her sensitive anus. She gasped at the sudden wet contact. \"What was that for?\" she asked, looking over her shoulder at her teacher. \n\nHe didn't reply. He was too intent upon spreading the spittle around her brown little ass-eye, working it into the radiating tiny puckers of beige-colored flesh. He twisted a finger at the converging point of the puckered ring, and Wendy caught her breath sharply as his finger broke through the circular muscle. He spread the slippery saliva all around the rim of her anus. \n\n\"What are you doooo-ing?\" she demanded, becoming increasingly alarmed. Ray pulled his finger from her asshole with a wet popping sound, then rolled on top of her. He\u2019d already freed his throbbing penis, and now it sandwiched into the crack of her vulnerable bottom.\n\n\"NOOOOH!\" Wendy cried as the full realization of what he intended to do suddenly hit her.\n\nBut she realized also that there was no escape as the Nutty Professor directed his stiff cock into the warm, satiny cleft. She gasped as the blunt snout of his penis pressed against her clenched rear aperture.\n\n'NOOOOOOOOH\"' she moaned again, \u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d\n\nHe was about to invade her rectum, she realized. She was going to be raped in the ass, and there was nothing she could do to stop it! \n\nIf she could have permitted her nether ring to relax and accept the man's prick as he thrust it against her, the pain wouldn't have been so intense. But she couldn't do that, even though she knew her situation was hopeless. Professor Pistachio had to batter his way into her ass--and that was what he did! \n\nHe was equal to the challenge. He reveled in it, in fact, as he gripped Wendy\u2019s ridiculously huge and super-soft tits, holding her in place. He pressed forward, his turgid prick forcing the tensed but slippery puckers of her anus to yield \n\n\"OOOOOH!\" Wendy bawled as pain soared in her bruised and battered anus. \u201cPLEEEEEASE!\" \n\nThe educator\u2019s ears were deaf to her cries for mercy. He pushed harder, grinding his prick all the while. Her anus was forced wider open, the tiny ring stretching and clutching inch by inch over his advancing cockhead until her asshole was stretched to the maximum around the fattest part of his enormous prick. \n\nWendy wailed. She clutched the bedclothes. It felt to the suffering young woman as if Dr. Pistashio were ripping her anus as he forged relentlessly into it. Finally his cockhead was sunk inside her hot tight ass, and her elastic ring snapped snugly into the groove behind his corona.\n\nThis partial relaxation of tension eased the first painful shock of penetration. However, Wendy could scarcely breathe calmly for it felt to her as if she had a fiery log jammed up her rear, and it was forging deeper all the time, wiggling and sinking farther into her bowels. She gasped. Little whines escaped her lips. Perhaps as bad as the physical discomfort, and worse than the humiliation of the mortifying ass-impalement, was the pain of the broken bond of trust between teacher and student.\n\nAs Raymond began to stroke, withdrawing an inch or so, then sinking even deeper than before, repeating and driving farther into her bottom with every thrust, her ass-stuffed discomfort and shameful humiliation increased. She sobbed loudly as tears gushed down her cheeks. \n\nGrunting, Ray increased the tempo of his stroking. Soon, he was fucking her tight asshole with a vengeance, sinking the full length of his prick with every plunge.\n\nHer tight anus was stretched around his thick, hard shaft, absorbing inch after inch of the rigid column, then relinquish it, the red membrane turning inside out to drag hotly along his retreating cock. Each time he reversed directions, the flesh folded inward with the thrust of his long penis. \n\n\"Aaaaaahhhhgh . . . ooooh ... your KILLLING meeee!\" Wendy moaned. \n\n\"Shut up and take it, Slut!\" Raymond barked, shoving his prick in and out of her asshole, enjoying the ravishment of her ass. \n\nSomething happened to Wendy at about that time. At first she could scarcely believe it, then she was forced to admit to herself that she found the ass fucking peculiarly pleasurable. Almost imperceptibly, she began to press backward against the rapist\u2019s vicious thrusts. \n\nHe fucked her harder and faster, powering his big prick up her ass. Wendy quickened her responsive motions, also. Soon she was totally caught up in the asshole-fucking frenzy as she slammed her asscheeks against her teacher\u2019s thundering lunges. \n\n\"OOOOH, YESSSS!\" she hissed. \"GIVE ME MORE! FUCK MY ASS HAAAARD! \" \n\nRay pounded his cudgel up her rectum, bouncing his balls against her sizzling pussy. Her entire crotch seemed suffused with flame, and she thrashed wildly, out of control, as her previously resistant anus gulped for deeper and more brutal penetration. \n\nAs Raymond bore down and into her ass, fucking fiercely, in a raging sadistic ravishment of her anus, he clutched her giant breasts as tightly as he could, crushing them in his palms. He fucked faster and faster, squeezing her tits at the same time, until she exploded with a shriek, her ass humping spastically against him. \n\nHis bowel-embedded prick jerked and spewed burst after burst of thick, warm cream into her nether depths. \n\nProfessor Raymond Pistachio sprawled over her as she sank flat against the mattress. At last she could relax. Great sighs were heaving from her. The rapist breathed hard, also, having enjoyed his vigorous exertions to the utmost. \n\n\u201cWas that rape?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cNo\u201d he replied. \u201cJust a dream.\u201d\n\nAdjusting his clothes, he shut the door behind himself, and walked down the steps.\n      [To read Part 2, the exciting conclusion to \"The Rape of the Drunken Slutwalk Co-ed\", please visit:   RapetownUSA.com   (and open the Central Park tab)   ]\n", "subreddit": "POLITIC", "created_utc": 1378940399, "id": "cc6hngq", "author": "RaymondPISTACHIO", "link_id": "t3_1m7553", "parent_id": "t3_1m7553", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Well, it's not that much about preventing you from catching it.

Why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatient: I don't work in the head office yet, because I don't yet fulfill all the requirements of the health authority one hundred percent. As I said, they are very, very careful with the whole thing, although I have already been told by the doctors that I am completely healthy and that I cannot infect other people by coughing anymore. So I should stay at home until the last piece of DNA of this virus is out of my body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarcus Fahn: That means that you are still being tested regularly at the moment?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatient: That's right, I'm still being tested regularly until it is really proven that even the last spark of this virus is gone. But this does not mean that the corona virus is still active in any way. They are now looking at the DNA. But that's a dead DNA, so to speak.\n\nMarcus Fahn: There was a lot of excitement in the environment of the sick people at Webasto, keyword \"kindergartens\", \"schools\", certainly also in the company itself. How did you feel about that? Patient: There was complete uncertainty again. It is known that I have the virus and that my daughter goes to the nursery. What I have to say is that my daughter's caregivers, i.e. the daily caregivers, handled it very professionally. They were never afraid of it. They are used to it when children have a cold or a cough. They didn't treat them any differently now. She was always healthy. She tested negative, even twice. So she was perfectly healthy. But you could still tell from other parents that they were hysterical. The parents' council of this daycare center also sent the police to the health department, because they thought that the health department should have closed the daycare center.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarcus Fahn: Let's assume that you were not infected, but someone else in your environment or in the environment of your child. Wouldn't you perhaps have had such fears or at least understood them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatient: Well, you have to distinguish between fear and concern. Well, I would have been worried if I had heard that. But I would have been more worried for the person who has it. But if I know that any person has been tested negative and if I then learn that the course of the disease is really not as the media report it, then I would of course calm down again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarcus Fahn: Now we have to assume that more people will be infected in the near future. What would you tell or advise them now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatient: First of all I would advise everyone to stay calm. It is of course a new virus, that is well known. But it is not as bad as the flu. So this is really a kind of cold. The bad thing is, you can detect the virus and then you are stamped. You just have to accept that. If you don't have any pre-existing conditions, it's never gonna be bad. But if you have a pre-existing condition and you get the flu, for example, then it will be much, much more serious. That's why I would advise everyone to take care of it first: if you have it, stay calm. If you don't have it, you should get vaccinated against the flu.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarcus Fahn: When do you think that your private life will return to a complete everyday life?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatient: For me, everyday life is already there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarcus Fahn: Well, but you are still at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatient: I am at home, but I am allowed to go out normally. I'm just not allowed to go to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarcus Fahn: How do people in your environment, friends, acquaintances, who know, that was the one with the coronavirus, how do they treat you since you are out?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatient: They treat me quite normally, because I am very open and honest with these people. They know very well that I was never really seriously ill. And they also know exactly that I am no longer contagious. Everything was tested on me. I've also been to a lung specialist. He took another look. There's nothing to see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarcus Fahn: And you would probably wish the same for all the other people in Germany who are now infected with it in the next few days and weeks and then hopefully, and this is how it looks, after a mostly mild course, will at some point be back to normal at home or at work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatient: Yes, that is correct.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarcus Fahn: Thank you very much for telling us your story and your view. I wish you and your family all the best and also the people in your environment that everything will calm down and the last rest of the daily routine will return to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatient: Thank you.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1582989913, "id": "fj3p8p2", "author": "GS_Hyperios", "link_id": "t3_fbdzq4", "parent_id": "t1_fj3p86j", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": true, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "I'm asking reddit for permission to buy a pizza from the local (nonchain) pizza place.

That list includes Wyoming, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Kansas. (One important caveat: Testing in the United States remains deficient, so many cases are inevitably flying under the radar. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that other places don\u2019t have cases,\u201d Toner said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t recognize them yet.\u201d)\n\nRepublican-leaning states to this point are displaying notably less urgency about the outbreak. Of the states that have taken the fewest actions to restrict public gatherings or limit restaurant service on a statewide basis\u2014such as Texas, Missouri, and Alabama\u2014almost all have Republican governors, according to research by Topher Spiro, the vice president for health policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, where he directs a program that examines state health initiatives.\n\nThat\u2019s left Democratic-run cities in those red states\u2014such as Houston, Tucson, Nashville, and Atlanta\u2014to try to impose their own rules on public gatherings. Yet all those local limits face an obvious problem: People from elsewhere in the state can still travel to their jurisdictions. \u201cWe can\u2019t seal our borders,\u201d acknowledged Lina Hidalgo, the chief administrator in Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston, when she announced county-wide closures on Monday.\n\nThe willingness to impose statewide rules hasn\u2019t entirely followed party lines: Before his announcement in California on Thursday, for example, Newsom had couched proposals to shut restaurants, schools, and other establishments as recommendations, not requirements, thus permitting a patchwork of local responses. But generally, Spiro\u2019s research found, almost all of the states that took the earliest and most dramatic statewide action, such as New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Illinois, have Democratic governors.\n\nPublic attitudes about the outbreak are separating along the same lines. The huge differences between Republicans and Democrats extend not only to assessments of Trump\u2019s response to the outbreak but also to its underlying level of danger and the need to change personal behavior. If anything, there\u2019s considerable evidence that those gaps are widening.\n\nA national Gallup poll released Monday, for instance, found that while 73 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of independents said they feared that they or someone in their family might be exposed to the coronavirus, only 42 percent of Republicans agreed. That 31-percentage-point difference dwarfed the gap in February, when slightly more Republicans (30 percent) than Democrats (26 percent) said they were concerned.\n\nOther surveys have found comparably stunning differences. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday, Republicans were only half as likely as Democrats to say that they planned to stop attending large gatherings, and just one-third as likely to say that they had cut back on eating at restaurants. In an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Tuesday, just over half of Republicans said the threat from the virus had been exaggerated, compared with one in five Democrats and two in five independents.\n\nRead: This is how Trump will be remembered\n\nIn a nationwide Kaiser Family Foundation poll released the same day, about half of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents said the outbreak had disrupted their life at least some, according to detailed results provided to me by the pollsters. But only one-third of Republicans and those who leaned Republican agreed. About half of Democrats said they had changed travel plans and decided not to attend large gatherings. In both cases, less than one-third of Republicans agreed.\n\nKabaservice says the tendency of GOP voters and officials to downplay the risk partly reflects Trump\u2019s initially dismissive messaging about the crisis. But it may also relate to a deeper ideological suspicion of scientists, the media, and subject-matter experts within the federal government.\n\n\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve gone through a while here among Republicans,\u201d Kabaservice says. \u201cThe feeling increasingly is that experts and the media are all part of this elite class that is self-dealing and is looking down on less-educated and less-fortunate people, and [that] they can\u2019t be trusted to tell the truth.\u201d He adds, \u201cThat dynamic \u2026 has been reinforced\u201d by the emergence of the \u201cconservative media ecosystem,\u201d which unstintingly presents \u201celites\u201d as a threat to viewers.\n\nThe parties\u2019 contrasting geographic bases of support may also have an influence. Recent public polling has found an imposing gulf in attitudes between urban and suburban areas on one side and small-town and rural areas on the other.\n\nIn the Gallup survey, two-thirds of urban residents and three-fifths of those in suburbs said they were concerned about someone around them contracting the coronavirus, while only about half of those living in rural areas agreed, according to detailed results provided to me by Gallup. (That town-and-country gap had widened since February.) In the Kaiser poll, more than two-thirds of rural residents said the outbreak had disrupted their life little or not at all, while nearly half of urban residents said they had already experienced disruption. Additionally, rural residents were almost twice as likely as those in urban areas to express confidence in Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis.\n\nEva Kassens-Noor, a professor in the global-urban-studies program at Michigan State University, studied urban/rural patterns in the 1918 flu pandemic in India. Her research found that mortality was much greater in urban places above a certain density level than in rural places below it. She believes that U.S. communities will experience the coronavirus in contrasting, but complex, ways: While the disease will probably spread more rapidly in urban areas, she says, more of the population there is young and healthy. And while outbreaks may not be as pervasive in rural America, they could still prove very damaging because the population is older and has less access to quality health care.\n\nMortality rates, she says, will ultimately hinge on how rigorously communities minimize interaction by practicing social distancing. \u201cIt is all about individuals closing all of their social networking,\u201d she says.\n\nMore penetration of the virus into reliably Republican rural regions probably won\u2019t erase the partisan gap in perception of the danger. The Republican pollster Bill McInturff, whose firm Public Opinion Strategies co-manages the NBC/WSJ poll, says that even Republicans in and around big cities remain much more dubious of the threat than their Democratic neighbors.\n\nBut if the outbreak becomes more widely dispersed over time, it may be tougher for even the most conservative governors to resist action\u2014or for Trump to escape consequences for his initially dismissive response.\n\n\u201cSeattle, San Francisco, New York, Boston are just a few weeks ahead of other parts of the country,\u201d Toner said. \u201cThere will be outbreaks in places that we will be very surprised by.

HPV to be specific. \n\nFrom the Oxford Journal of Medicine:\n\n\u201c**Study Background** Lack of circumcision has been identified as a risk factor for male genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, although this association has not been consistently supported. \n\n**Methods** Specimens for HPV testing were collected from a cohort of 379 (primarily heterosexual) adult males. HPV prevalence in the glans penis and coronal sulcus, penile shaft, scrotum, semen, and urine was compared by circumcision status. \n\n\n**Results** Overall, HPV DNA prevalence ranged from 6% in semen to 52% in the penile shaft. *The prevalence of any HPV infection in the glans/corona was significantly higher in uncircumcised men (46%) than in circumcised men (29%)* (odds ratio [OR], 1.96 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.02\u20133.75], adjusted for demographic characteristics and sexual history). *Uncircumcised men also had an increased risk of oncogenic HPV infection* (adjusted OR, 2.51 [95% CI, 1.11-5.69]) and infection with multiple HPV types (adjusted OR, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.50\u20138.50]). Among uncircumcised men, HPV prevalence in the foreskin (44%) was comparable to that in the glans/corona, and type-specific positivity was observed between the 2 sites (\u03ba=0.52). \n\n**Conclusions** Uncircumcised men have an increased risk of HPV infection, including with oncogenic HPV, specifically localized to the glans/corona, possibly because of its proximity to the foreskin, which may be particularly vulnerable to infection.\u201d\n\n**TL;DR:** Uncut dicks have 15% more prevelance of HPV bacteria. \n\nI would have posted this as a response to the children saying I\u2019m insecure, but they already blocked me for telling them their dicks aren\u2019t clean in response to the insults. Call me mutilated, call me dog penis, call me whatever you want. **My dick is less like give my wife cancer.** \n\nTo be clear, stop cutting baby dicks. I\u2019m not supporting that, It\u2019s terrible. Let young men make the choice themselves, at an appropriate age. \n\nStop insulting cut dicks in this thread.

He would look like pirate if he had a gold earring in all honesty.\n\n\"Highideas, we are going to the strip club on a Sunday.\"   So we do.  We put all of our luggage in the bellhop area downstairs at the Mirage so we are unencumbered and head out to a strip club.\n\nWe roll to a place called Treasures.   Now I won't lie.  I was SUPER impressed with the level of talent on a Sunday.   We were having a great time.   I even had a \"Top 5\" lap dance that day from a girl from Portland.  Go figure.\n\nAnyway, it is getting closer and closer to our time.  Big Phil didn't want to leave as he has been drinking MASSIVE amounts of Corona.   And by massive I mean in the few hours we had been there I counted at least 16.   So I finally convince him we have to leave.   We get treasures to drive us in their limo back to the mirage.   In the limo Big Phil has not only brought 3 coronas in his pockets but begins slamming Crown and Coke like it was his job.   He puts all the booze down that he had in the 10 minute ride.    I grab our bags and the limo takes us to the airport.   We were going to cut it close....\n\nFast forward.   Most of the booze in the limo was now gone.   He had polished off the crown and was working through whatever else was in there.    We get to the airport and he tips the driver $120.\n\nWe hustle...the line was short.   Southwest.   He is going to carry on his garment bag and I have a small carry on and some other luggage.    We check in.\n\nAt this point he is walking and a look of frightened soberness comes over his face.   \"I HAVE GOT TO PISS\".   Now, to let you know what kind of guy Big Phil is, he had on thin khaki shorts...no unders.   Yeah that is his uniform to the strip club.     We are running to hit the restroom because I figure I better piss too.    I hit the urinal and he hits the handicap stall.\n\n\"OHHHHHHHHHHHHH SHIIIIIIIIIT\"    Is all I hear.   I finish up thinking that he was just relieving himself and all was right with the world.    He comes walking out.\n\nHe has on black sweats.    Apparently in the stall he had tried to set his bag down and hit his zipper just right and the piss was coming.   He pissed all over himself!    He had pull out some sweats from the garment bag threw them on and threw his wet shorts back in the bag!\n\nThis guy has literally pissed himself 4-5 times.   That isn't even the worst part.

Real soon.\n\n&gt; Election in the time of Covid-19?\n\n&gt; The release of the report comes amidst a flurry of developments on the Covid-19 front.\n\n&gt; With an increasing number of confirmed cases, the government has announced a slew of enhanced precautionary measures from Stay-Home Notices, travel restrictions and advisories.\n\n&gt; Just days before the EBRC report was out, Gan Kim Yong, the minister for health and co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, announced that all ticketed events with 250 or more participants are to be cancelled or deferred.\n\n&gt; Owners of dining venues were also advised to reduce close contact between patrons.\n\n&gt; With such social distancing measures, it may seem counterintuitive to hold the election anytime soon, since the process of political campaigning and polling typically involves interaction with large groups of people.\n\n&gt; In response to the release of the EBRC report, opposition parties have also put out statements urging the government to focus on the battle against Covid-19.\n\n&gt; The Progress Singapore Party also told Mothership that it hopes Singapore can focus on the containment of Covid-19 for now.\n\n&gt; Citing the lack of urgency for an election \u2014 given the current parliamentary term ends in April 2021 \u2014 the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) also called on the government to \u201ccategorically rule out the GE\u201d, until it is clear we are seeing the \u201ctail-end of the virus spread\u201d.\n\n&gt; The SDP added that this would show that \u201cthe PAP is putting its own interests over the people\u2019s safety\u201d.\n\n&gt; The Workers\u2019 Party (WP), the only opposition party with parliament seats, urged the government to \u201ctake caution and exercise judiciousness\u201d in calling for a GE.\n\n&gt; In its statement on March 15, WP said that the government\u2019s decision \u201cmust be one that is in the the best interests of Singapore, our democracy and the public health of Singaporeans\u201d.\n\n&gt; The PAP seeking a \u201cfresh\u201d mandate\n\n&gt; But there may be a good reason for the PAP to call for GE sooner than later.\n\n&gt; Firstly, it could be a way for the PAP to secure a strong mandate to tackle the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n&gt; PM Lee hinted at this on March 14, saying that the election date will depend on what will best see Singapore through the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n&gt; He said that Singapore has two choices:\n\n&gt; \u201cEither hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances \u2013 but we have no certainty of that. Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.\u201d\n\n&gt; Opposition disadvantaged on several fronts\n\n&gt; Some analysts that Today spoke to, however, have explained how calling for the GE now will disadvantage the opposition.\n\n&gt; We are in (heading into?) crises times\n\n&gt; Historically, the ruling party tends to see landslide victories in times of great global uncertainty and crises.\n\n&gt; For instance, the 2001 General Election, which took place months after the September 11 attacks, saw the PAP winning with a overwhelming 75 per cent vote share.\n\n&gt; Incidentally, 2001 was also the first election held in Singapore after the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997.\n\n&gt; Currently, Singapore (and the world) is facing a health pandemic on a global scale, and the threat of a financial recession looms.\n\n&gt; The virus crisis is likely to be a political boon for the ruling party as Singapore heads into a deeply uncertain future \u2014 understandably, voters do not want to \u201crock the boat\u201d during such times.\n\n&gt; The ruling party is further advantaged by its management of Covid-19, which has earned praise from even the World Health Organisation for our containment efforts.\n\n&gt; Infectious disease specialist Dale Fisher, who has also been involved with the World Health Organisation\u2019s Global Outbreak Alert &amp; Response Network (GOARN) for 15 years, also said:\n\n&gt; \u201cOverall, internationally, I don\u2019t believe the world is ready for this outbreak. But Singapore is.\u201d\n\n&gt; Privileges those with great resources\n\n&gt; Secondly, Covid-19 will inadvertently affect how rallies are run.\n\n&gt; And this is likely to advantage parties with greater resources.\n\n&gt; For instance, analysts that spoke to Today suggested that event organisers would have to implement temperature screening measures, book multiple venues to ensure adequate segregation of participants, and also consider live-streaming debates on social media.\n\n&gt; This would likely result in huge logistical costs, which disadvantages opposition parties with fewer resources.\n\n&gt; Nature of opposition rallies\n\n&gt; Going digital also fundamentally alters the way politicians interact with electors, and hence, alters the entire campaigning experience in a way that may disadvantage the opposition.\n\n&gt; Opposition party rallies have historically seen much larger crowds than those organised by the PAP.\n\n&gt; But what does crowd size really mean?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s the argument that more people at opposition party rallies means more votes for them.\n\n&gt; But crowds may not necessarily reflect voter sentiment either.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, rallies are still a crucial mode in which the opposition canvases for votes from swing voters.\n\n&gt; These undecided voters are more likely to attend rallies and spend more time reading up on party campaigns before polling.\n\n&gt; And needless to say, physically standing in a crowd and listening to powerful speeches during a rally is vastly different from watching a video uploaded to your Facebook feed.\n\n&gt; Yes, this disadvantages the opposition. But this isn\u2019t new.\n\n&gt; Terence Lee said in a commentary published by CNA that Covid-19 is the \u201celephant in the room that may be the ultimate game-changer\u201d,\n\n&gt; But even without this external crisis facing us, the attainment of the PAP\u2019s effective political dominance in Singapore means that the opposition in Singapore has been historically disadvantaged.\n\n&gt; In Is the PAP here to stay?, Associate Professor Bilveer Singh elaborated on how performance legitimacy of the PAP, coupled with entrenchment of its power, has made it difficult for the opposition to replace this ruling party.\n\n&gt; Since the PAP has attained parliamentary dominance since 1959, they have successfully met various challenges to secure economic and social stability.\n\n&gt; They have since then also secured control over political and non-political organisations in Singapore.\n\n&gt; The party has also engineered the rules of engagement \u2014 seen in the case of gerrymandering, where electoral boundaries are carved out by the ruling party to better their chances of increasing vote share.\n\n&gt; Lee pointed out that the three SMCs (Sengkang West, Punggol East and Fengshan) that have disappeared in this year\u2019s EBRC report have been \u201cstrong stomping ground for WP candidates since 2011\u201d.\n\n&gt; We see the effects of politics in everyday life as well, in something as banal (but important, nevertheless) as lift upgrading.\n\n&gt; Workers Party former-NCMP Yee Jenn Jong had argued that the PAP has been subtly (and sometimes openly) crafting the narrative that support for the opposition would adversely affect Singapore\u2019s well-being and stability.\n\n&gt; In 2011, a university student asked PM Lee why opposition wards are not treated as well as PAP wards \u2014 namely, PAP wards being prioritised when it comes to resource allocation and upgrading programmes.\n\n&gt; PM Lee said:\n\n&gt; \u201cThere has to be a distinction. Because the PAP wards supported the government and the policies which delivered these good things\u2026 Between the people who voted and supported the programme and the government, and the people who didn\u2019t, I think if we went and put yours before the PAP constituencies, it would be an injustice.\u201d\n\n&gt; Difficulties will always lay ahead\n\n&gt; The opposition acknowledges that while these are very real challenges, the truth is, many key opposition parties aren\u2019t interested in replacing the PAP as the ruling party (yet).\n\n&gt; Parties like the Workers\u2019 Party, for instance, are more focused on challenging the ruling party by winning more parliamentary seats and having a greater voice in Parliament.\n\n&gt; Their 2015 manifesto wrote:\n\n&gt; \u201cA Parliament monopolised by one party fails the test of rigorous debate and voting in forging sound policies\u2026 A Parliament that includes MPs from a rational, responsible and respectable opposition party compels the government to listen to the collective wisdom of the people.\u201d\n\n&gt; There will always be difficulties that lay ahead for Singapore\u2019s opposition.\n\n&gt; It always had since 1965.\n\n&gt; But the possibility of emerging victorious (arguably against rather stacked odds) to create a better future for Singapore, will continue to propel many to diligently work towards their political goals.\n\n&gt; Top photo by Mothership.sg\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "subreddit": "singapore", "created_utc": 1584512239, "id": "fktb1j3", "author": "sneakpeek_bot", "link_id": "t3_fkkxl8", "parent_id": "t3_fkkxl8", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Can someone kindly create a thread of its own as I am new here. Camostat is $0.08 per tablet potential Corona killer as previously published in highly reputed sites such as Cell, Nature and Forbes.\nA clinical study is finally about to begin.\nIf the world get more attention, we can kick slow Japanese, me included, to expedite.\n\n[Nikkei Business ](https://business.nikkei.com/atcl/gen/19/00110/031600009/) \n\nEffective for new corona?  Unexpected pharmaceuticals in Japan with high expectations\n\n\u00a0March 16, 2020\n\nThe spread of the new coronavirus infection does not stop.  Vaccines and therapeutics are also being developed around the world, but it is necessary to confirm safety and efficacy in clinical trials through animal experiments, and it will take years to commercialize, including the development of mass production systems.  right.\n What if drugs that have already been approved and widely used can be used as they are?  Validation of efficacy and safety can be done more quickly, increasing the likelihood of getting to market faster.  From such a viewpoint, expectations for certain pharmaceutical products in Japan are increasing.\n The drug is camostat mesylate, which is used to treat chronic pancreatitis.  A drug that inhibits the action of proteolytic enzymes, created by Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and launched in 1985 under the name of Huoipan Tablets.  Substance patents have already expired, and a number of generic manufacturers in the country are selling drugs with the same ingredients.  Earlier in March, German researchers reported in the renowned scientific journal Cell that the drug could block the transmission of the new coronavirus, and has received attention.\n Researchers say that when the new coronavirus infects human cells, it binds to a receptor protein called ACE2 on the cell membrane, and then TMPRSS2, a type of enzyme called serine protease also on the cell membrane.  Was used to find out that it had entered the cell.  Camostat is known to block TMPRSS2, and has never been tested at the laboratory level to prevent coronavirus infection, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).  Has also been reported.  In this paper, researchers have confirmed in experiments using cultured cells that camostat can prevent infection of cells with both the new coronavirus and the SARS virus.\n According to the paper, however, it is necessary to administer significantly higher doses than are currently prescribed for medicines to prevent infection.  However, in 2016, another research group reported in a mouse experiment with animals that camostat prevents SARS virus infection.  At this time, the mice received 30 milligrams per kilogram of body weight twice daily.  There is a calculation formula that converts the amount of effect in mice to humans, and when applied to humans, it is calculated to be effective in two doses of about 150 milligrams a day.  Camostat is given 200 mg three times a day for chronic pancreatitis.  In other words, the same amount that has been used for chronic pancreatitis for many years may be effective against the new coronavirus.\n Camostat has been approved only in Japan and South Korea, so development in other countries will probably need to be done through animal experiments.  Even in Japan, it is not a drug approved for pneumonia, so it is necessary to conduct clinical studies on patients with severe pneumonia and verify its safety and efficacy in the future.  Nevertheless, the fastest way to commercialize it is to conduct clinical research in Japan using drugs used in Japan and verify its effectiveness.\n Ono commented on this paper, saying, \"We did not actively consider it because the results in this paper were significantly higher than those used in clinical practice.  We will respond, but there is no request at the moment. \"\n Some academia has expressed expectations.  Naoto Uemura, Director of Clinical Pharmacology Center, Oita University Hospital, said, `` It is necessary to carefully consider how much effect can be obtained, but if it is effective by diverting existing drugs, early commercialization is expected.  I can do it. \"  Another national university seems to be planning clinical research.\n A drug that has already been approved and distributed in Japan and is expected to be effective against pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus is Kaletra, an anti-AIDS virus (HIV) drug from AbbVie, USA (generic name: lopinavir ritonavir)  There is also Orbesco (ciclesonide), a treatment for bronchial asthma sold by Teijin Pharma.  Ciclesonide reports that a prefectural hospital in Kanagawa Prefecture administered to three patients with pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, and all three patients improved.  Teijin Pharma Limited announced on March 10 that it will secure 20,000 of the drug and supply it to clinical research, etc. at the request of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.  The anti-influenza drug Avigan (favipiravir) is also expected to be effective against the new coronavirus, but the approval of Avigan is for stockpiling and has not been widely used in clinical practice.\n Either way, we hope to find a way to counter the new coronavirus more quickly by converting existing drugs.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584423945, "id": "fkpyypp", "author": "nemoys7", "link_id": "t3_fjzpm1", "parent_id": "t3_fjzpm1", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Red city tumbleweed: A short story \n\nIt appears to be wet and dreary day, as I peek through the lightly dusted blinds of my old brownstone window.\n\n\"A walk is doable,\" I said to myself. The thought of a ride in the city's deprived subway system amidst a virus epidemic didn't have any appeal to me today.\n\nI turn to grab my red umbrella. I keep it nestled in an old-fashioned copper bucket by the foyer. As I swing the door behind myself and take a few steps down the stoop, I notice an empty bottle kept company by a pile of cigarettes.  It's a familiar site, although I've never actually seen the man who leaves behind his sorrows for me to ponder. I've actually come to enjoy the ritual... thinking about what unfolded in the man's day before resting a cheap bottle of Brandy on my steps. \n\nIt's not unusual for me to take notice of something and then wonder off in thought about it.  It happens all the time.  I tell people I'm just ADD but I don't really know why I'm this way.  \n\nUnfortunately, I fail to take notice that my door latch doesn't click. Suddenly I am four blocks towards the bridge before I snap back and realize that everyone around me has their umbrellas up over them. My hair is already soaking wet and I don't know whether to blame myself or the drunk.  I suppose I may as well just keep walking in the rain... it's not as if my umbrella would make a difference at this point, but I open it up anyways.\n\nNow, I should mention that I appreciate a degree of quality.  I'm willing to reach a little deeper into my pocket if the expense is warranted.  I am also no stranger to the aftermath of a storm in my city; the ground is littered with tattered and twisted cheap china-made umbrellas.  I'm not interested in taking part in such a mindless circus of littering.  So this particular umbrella was unlike others and fit me nicely.   It was sturdy and strong.  It was crafted to weather a real storm. It won't flip inside out and betray me to the rain. It's quality. \n\nIt's at this precise moment that I turn a corner and walk into an icey blast of wind; it's not uncommon in the city to discover a wind tunnel, especially on the riverside.  The rest happens fast.  The gust meets my umbrella and my arms buckle. It is by my instinct that I use my strength to prevent the wind from casting the umbrella off into the city's own special abyss. After all, it has quality. It's sturdy.  A little wind isn't going to flip it out. And I am not going to lose it.\n\nThree forceful strides is all it took.  I don't even turn to look.  My hair is wet and covering my eyes. There's an impact and a moment. Everything goes quiet and still. My mind starts to wonder and my hand goes limp.  The red umbrella finds a vortex and speeds off, almost dancing in the wind as it dissapears from sight.  \n\nLater that night a man is smoking a cigarette and holding a bottle of brandy as he stumbles down an alley. Forgotten umbrellas blow past him like tumbleweeds. Although one of them stands out; it's red and seemingly brand new. He picks it up and carries it with him as he strides into the night.  Later he finds himself in a familiar place outside the steps of an old brownstone. He places his empty bottle onto the top step as he sits and leans back into the door.  Unfortunately for the man, the door is ajar and swings open under his weight.  He falls backwards tossing the umbrella up into the air. Scampering up and not realizing he no longer holds the umbrella, he clumsily escapes from his blunder and rushes away, flicking his cigarette towards the bottle as he nearly trips down the steps and off into the night.\n\nMy eyes go back into focus and I take my hand off the blinds hastily...they click back into shape and spew a bit of dust into my face.  Holding back a sneeze I throw on my jacket and race for the door, realizing I'm late for work. I stop quickly in my tracks nearly tripping over my red umbrella. I think to myself...\"that's odd for it to be on the floor.\" Nonetheless, I place it back into the copper bucket, close the door behind me and speed off with a strange feeling.\n\nAt least it's beautiful out. It should make for a pleasant walk to work.\n\n\u26f1\ufe0f", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "created_utc": 1584339606, "id": "fkmtmyt", "author": "Chaserivx", "link_id": "t3_fjcje5", "parent_id": "t3_fjcje5", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": true, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "And since he has changed his position.

In severe cases it can be fatal, due to respiratory paralysis.\n\nSome people mistakenly believe that polio usually leads to paralysis, but this isn't the case.\n\n95% of people exposed to the natural polio virus don't exhibit any symptoms, even under epidemic conditions, according to the Physicians' Desk Reference 2001 and Natural History of Infectious Disease by Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet and David O. White.\n\nThe Wikipedia article on polio initially cites the figure as 90%, but elsewhere on the page the \u201casymptomatic\u201d outcome of poliovirus infection is listed as 90%-95%. According to the source used for these statistics, \u201cUp to 95% of all polio infections are inapparent or asymptomatic.\u201d\n\nAbout 5% of infected people will experience mild symptoms such as a sore throat, stiff neck, headache, and fever\u2014often diagnosed as a cold or flu. Muscular paralysis affects approximately one out of every 1,000 people who contract polio.\n\nThis has lead some scientific researchers to conclude that the small percentage of people who do develop paralytic polio may be anatomically susceptible to the disease. The vast remainder of the population may be naturally immune to the polio virus. [Moskowitz, R. \u201cImmunizations: the other side.\u201d Mothering (Spring 1984):36]\n\nUsually there is a full recovery from paralytic polio\u2014it rarely is permanent. Only a small percentage of cases will experience residual paralysis.\n\nThere are many serious questions about what factors contribute to increasing an individual's susceptibility to serious adverse reactions to the polio virus.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that injections, either for vaccines or antibiotics, increase susceptibility to polio. It's been known since the early 1900s that paralytic poliomyelitis can start at the site of an injection.\n\nWhen diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were introduced in the 1940s, cases of paralytic poliomyelitis skyrocketed. This was documented in Lancet and other medical journals.\n\nMcCloskey, BP. \u201cThe relation of prophylactic inoculations to the onset of poliomyelitis.\u201d Lancet (April 18, 1950):659-63\n\nGeffen, DH \u201cThe incidence of paralysis occurring in London children within four weeks after immunization.\u201d Med Officer 1950;83:137-40\n\nMartin, JK. \u201cLocal paralysis in children after injections.\u201d Arch Dis Child 1950;25:1-14\n\nIn 1949, the Medical Research Council in Great Britain set up a committee to investigate the matter and ultimately concluded that individuals are at increased risk of paralysis for 30 days following injections; injections alter the distribution of paralysis; and it did not matter whether the injections were subcutaneous or intramuscular.\n\nIn 1992, a study was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases that again confirmed these results after documenting an outbreak of polio in Oman that was linked to the DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) shot. They concluded that \u201cinjections are an important cause of provocative poliomyelitis.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study showing that children who received a single injection within one month after receiving a polio vaccine were 8 times more likely to contract polio than children who received no injections. \n\nThe risk jumped 27-fold when children received up to nine injections...and with ten or more injections, the likelihood of developing polio was 182 times greater than expected. \n\nWhy injections increase the risk of polio is unclear. Nevertheless, these studies and others indicate that \u201cinjections must be avoided in countries with endemic poliomyelitis.\u201d Health authorities believe that all \u201cunnecessary\u201d injections should be avoided as well.\n\nA poor diet has been shown to raise one's susceptibility to polio. \n\nIn 1948, during the height of the polio epidemics, Dr. Benjamin Sandler, a nutritional expert at the Oteen Veterans' Hospital, documented a link between polio and an excessive use of sugars and starches. \n\nHe compiled records showing that countries with the highest per capita consumption of sugar, such as the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and Sweden (with over 100 pounds per person per year) had the greatest incidence of polio. In contrast, polio was practically unheard of in China (with its sugar use of only 3 pounds per person per year).\n\nSandler claimed that sugars and starches lower blood sugar levels which leads to hypoglycemia.\n\nSuch food dehydrate the cells and leech calcium from the body. A serious calcium deficiency precedes polio. Researchers have always known that polio strikes with its greatest intensity during the hot summer months. \n\nDr. Sandler observed that children consume greater amounts of ice cream, soft drinks, and artificially sweetened products in hot weather. In 1949, before the polio season began, he warned the residents of North Carolina, through the newspapers and radio, to decrease their consumption of these products. \n\nThat summer, North Carolinians reduced their intake of sugar by 90%; polio decreased by the same amount! The North Carolina State Health Department reported 2,498 cases of polio in 1948 and 229 cases in 1949. [Data taken from North Carolina State Health Department figures]\n\nOne manufacturer shipped one million less gallons of ice cream during the first week alone following the publication of Dr. Sandler's anti-polio diet. Soft drink sales were down as well.\n\nBut powerful Rockefeller Milk Trust, which sold frozen products to North Carolinians, combined forces with soft drink business leaders and convinced the public that Sandler's findings were a myth and the polio figures a fluke. By the summer of 1950 sales were back to previous levels and polio cases returned to \u201cnormal.\u201d [McBean, E., Allen, H.]\n\nAs can be seen by this graph of United States polio rates, polio epidemics became a serious problem in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although it never quite reached the levels of 1916 (when the epicenter of the epidemic was mere miles from a Rockefeller research lab that was experimenting with an extremely virulent strain of the polio virus). \n\nBy the early 1950s, Jonas Salk began experimenting with a possible polio vaccine. \n\nIn 1952, Salk combined three types of polio virus grown in cultures made from monkey kidneys. Using formaldehyde, he was able to \u201ckill\u201d or inactivate the viral matter so that it would trigger an antibody response without causing the disease.\n\nIn 1955, the first polio immunization campaign was launched in the United States. Almost immediately, it became clear that something was very wrong with the vaccine. In the end, 70,000 school children became seriously ill from Salk's vaccine\u2014the infamous \u201cCutter Incident.\u201d \n\nThe mistake resulted in the production of 120,000 doses of polio vaccine that contained live polio virus. Of the children who received the vaccine, 40,000 developed abortive poliomyelitis. The Cutter incident was one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in U.S. history.\n\nThe renowned surgeon Alton Ochsner even gave the vaccine to two of his grandchildren...one died and the other was paralyzed. \u201cApparently, Salk's killed-virus vaccine was not completely inactivated.\u201d\n\n", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "created_utc": 1550421518, "id": "ego3bbq", "author": "redditready1986", "link_id": "t3_arar1m", "parent_id": "t1_egnvjyj", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "If you are in lockdown or just bored, go to my IG and participate in my story-poll with questions about your attitude towards the corona pandemic\ud83d\ude02 @itsmariahok", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584100080, "id": "fkdylpj", "author": "sushisho", "link_id": "t3_fhgnn3", "parent_id": "t3_fhgnn3", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "There\u2019s no aliens.

But Minister Chan\u2019s comments acknowledge that there is value in being proactive and forthcoming from the start. \n\n&gt; This is quite a different tune from the one he was singing a couple of weeks ago, when he met MP Pritam Singh\u2019s questions about Singapore\u2019s workforce with the now-infamous, \u201cWhat is the point of the question?\u201d\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; When it comes to releasing data, the government\u2019s attitude has generally been that less is more. \n\n&gt; A few recent examples: when POFMA was being debated in Parliament last year, Minister K Shanmugam rejected MP Louis Ng and NMP Irene Quay\u2019s calls for a Freedom of Information Act. His reasons? Civil servants would be \u201cinundated\u2019\u201dwith \u201codd requests\u201d, and such an Act would mainly benefit lawyers, businessmen, and journalists (never mind that it\u2019s our job to ask questions). \n\n&gt; And on January 20th, in a speech at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) conference, Minister Chan (yes, him again) audaciously declared that sharing data \u201cwill not be a panacea to policy issues\u201d. \n\n&gt; He then followed up with this gem:\n\n&gt; \u201cIf people don\u2019t trust you, you can give as much data as you want, and you will not win over the hearts or the minds of the people.\u201d\n\n&gt; I\u2019m sorry, but this is absolutely bonkers.\n\n&gt; Saying that people\u2019s trust is a prerequisite for releasing information is completely backwards. Being forthcoming with information is what creates trust. It is the ultimate gesture of transparency from a government which understands that a vice grip on information doesn\u2019t guarantee control. It only gives the impression of having something to hide.\n\n&gt; A public health crisis like the Wuhan virus outbreak shows how an open, communicative government is critical to maintaining public confidence. When authorities insist on withholding information, they effectively cede control of the narrative. And in the absence of clear direction, people will automatically assume the worst.\n\n&gt; When the virus was first detected in Wuhan, public health officials claimed that the illness posed little danger. According to the Guardian, the official line from China\u2019s national health commission was that the situation was \u201ccontrollable\u201d.\n\n&gt; Before you could so much as sneeze, hundreds of people were sick. Wuhan went into lockdown. People started speculating that millions had \u2018fled\u2019 the city ahead of time, though nobody knew for sure (or if it was just Chinese New Year travel). \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 videos began circulating on Weibo and WhatsApp, purportedly showing bodies lying on gurneys in Chinese hospitals and \u2018nurses\u2019 claiming the body count was being wildly under-declared.  \n\n&gt; It\u2019s possible that some of the rumours were trolls at work. It\u2019s also possible that some of them stemmed from ordinary people, badly spooked, who had resorted to filling information gaps with guesswork.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; To give the Singapore government credit, it has done a good job so far in keeping the public informed about the outbreak. \n\n&gt; The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been providing regular updates about suspected and/or confirmed cases, including contact tracing. News about travel restrictions, quarantine sites, mandatory leaves of absence for returning travellers, and enhanced screening and checks appears daily. Ministers have taken pains to appear on the ground, and reassure the public that robust measures are in place to manage the situation. \n\n&gt; All this goes to show that being forthright goes a long way towards maintaining people\u2019s trust.\n\n&gt; This point stands whether or not there is an ongoing crisis. An emergency like the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak makes the need for transparency more obvious, but how an organisation responds in an emergency is only as good as its practices on an average day.\n\n&gt; If leaders are already cagey and defensive in the best of times, or don\u2019t trust their people to act sensibly, this probably won\u2019t change during the worst.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Most recently, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong invoked POFMA against a Hardwarezone forum post, which falsely claimed that an elderly Singaporean man had died of the Wuhan coronavirus. \n\n&gt; The post was made at 5:50 PM on Sunday, January 26th. What followed was swift and painless: the POFMA office issued a Correction Notice that night, and SPH Magazines complied by Monday morning. The post was taken down and a correction posted in its stead.\n\n&gt; This was the sixth time POFMA was invoked since it came into force late last year. We can argue over whether the first five cases were ham-fisted bids to stifle political dissent, or good-faith attempts to combat disinformation. \n\n&gt; In this case, it was clear that MOH had good cause to act without delay. Exploiting people\u2019s fears to stir panic in a crisis is utterly reprehensible. \n\n&gt; But a further point to be drawn from all this is that resistance to releasing information creates the perfect kind of breeding ground for rumours, conspiracy theories, and yes, fake news, that POFMA was meant to combat. \n\n&gt; Tackling fake news becomes even more challenging when there is a fundamental imbalance in access to information. Disinformation spread by malicious actors is one thing, but speculation born of ignorance is another. \n\n&gt; As NMP Walter Theseira pointed out during the Second Reading of POFMA in Parliament, differences in opinion are bound to arise when the public only has partial information. If only the government has the full picture, then it shouldn\u2019t be affronted when people try to fill the holes with guesswork. \n\n&gt; Of course some people will approach data with a confirmation bias (as Minister Chan raised in rebuttal at the IPS conference). Of course others will use it to prod the government with uncomfortable questions.\n\n&gt; But the former\u2019s blind spots will speak for themselves, and the latter is what engaged citizens are supposed to do. You can\u2019t cherry-pick when it comes to active citizenship. If our politicians want Singaporeans to be clear-eyed, digitally literate, and actively invested in this country\u2019s future, then they need to give us the information we need to know what we\u2019re doing.\n\n&gt; The reality of our world now is that social media will always be flooded with fake news. Even the most liberal use of POFMA (god forbid) would be like holding up a Band-Aid to a tidal wave. \n\n&gt; And if\u2014as I\u2019m sure the government would agree\u2014we all have an interest in distinguishing fact from fiction, then it should be more upfront in giving us the data to tell the difference.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; If you\u2019re wondering what the point of this op-ed was, direct your complaints to community@ricemedia.co .

She was having a family/friends graduation party, and I was invited.  Now, we had been going out for about two months prior to this and I REALLY liked this attractive girl.  Little did I know that  I was about to completely ruin this girl's entire graduation party.\n\nAt this age, I was still learning my drinking boundaries and would sometimes get black-out drunk due to the horrible combination of anti-depressants and xanex I was taking (I was dumb in college).  Anyway, before going to the party, my roommates told me not to get too drunk and that this was my chance to make a good impression on the family....I should have listened to them.\n\nSo we get to this party and all is going well in the beginning.  Good Mexican food, music, and nice weather.  Being 20 I wasn't sure if I was allowed to drink but early into the party, her dad handed me a Corona.  I drank it and drank another one...and another one...and another one.  I felt like I was the center of the party, a natural Don Juan of the graduation parties...too bad I was about to take it WAY to far.\n\nNext thing I remember is coming to in her parents' car.  I was crying and my girlfriend was not in the car with me...just me and the parents.  My parents lived close to where her graduation party was and apparently I was giving them directions to the house, however, due to my obliteration, I was getting them lost for about 2 hours.  By the way, it was like 4am.  I finally get dropped off at my parents house and was so upset that I made my mom take me back to my dorm where I proceeded to cry and smoke pot in front of her (again, I was dumb).  Meanwhile, I had no idea what I had done at the party.\n\nFast forward to the next day when my girlfriend decides to see me and enlightens me on what happened when I blacked out for hours at her party.  Here is the rundown of stupid shit that got me kicked out of her house to the point that her parents drove me home:\n\n-Got shitfaced drunk and overall made an ass out of myself by speaking vulgarly, and refusing to stop drinking even though her dad called me out and said I was 20 and needed to stop.\n\n-During picture sharing time, I was looking at a picture of my girlfriend and two of her cousins.  The moms of those cousins (my gf's aunts) were sitting right besides me.  I proceeded to comment, \"Damn [girlfriend] you are definitely prettier than her, but your other cousin is extremely hot!\" (something like that)...what I basically did was tell her one aunt that her daughter was ugly and the other aunt that I wanted to sex her daughter, all the while my girlfriend was sitting besides me.\n\n-In another instant, I tried hitting on one of those aunts.  I put my arm around her and said some things that I am sure sounded confident and suave in my head, but definitely came out creepy and disgusting.\n\n-Called my girlfriend a bitch and a whore which made her cry.  Not sure why I said that to her.  Her dad heard me call her a bitch and this is where I get kicked out.  At that point he told me to get out of his house and then, along with the mother, took me home to my parents house.\n\nWe broke up shortly after this event (SURPRISE).  Yeah, I don't drink much at any girlfriend's family/friend functions now.

But that's just it. In our mind, making a joke linking the flag and the disease doesn't necessarily go that much deeper - there aren't some \"fuck the chinese\" or \"ha! that'll teach them\" sentiment behind it\n\nSure - others might interpret that. But when it comes to humor, Danes are very much in the \"offense is taken, not given\" camp. If we joke about something, and there is no ill intent - we don't care as much that other people interpret some ill intent.\n\nI know it's a non-apology, but the response \"I'm sorry that you feel offended\", actually describes the sentiment pretty well. (in a non-ironic way)\n\nDanish humor is very crass in some circles (such a the internet and several major newspapers)\n\nCan't speak for older history, but a defining moment in the 00'es was the [Muhammad cartoons crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy). In terms of popular opinion, one thing that was cemented was that we are not apologising for caricatures, purely because they cause offence.\n\nFor both the Muhammed Crisis and this Corona flag, there is the parallel that an apology was demanded by the Danish state. As we have press freedom, this becomes a joke in itself - as the state has no means to force this apology. \n\nAt that point, jokes start popping up in the form of \"look at this country, who can't even fathom press freedom\". That's probably where you see people making fun of e.g. the chinese. Not due to the virus, but because their cultural understanding is so limited, that they think that the government can be expected to apologise for the action of some newspaper.\n\nThe crassness becomes a point of pride at some point - a (bad) comparison could be open-carry people in America. They will walk around with a visible gun - not to trigger people, but because they feel some amount of pride in being able to carry this weapon openly. \n\nThis became a much longer post than expected. \n\nI'll end on this [picture](https://jyllands-posten.dk/debat/kronik/ECE11918710/kaere-sofie-hagen-hvis-folk-foelger-din-opfordring-doer-de/).

I\u2019ll take a moment to note that Sth Korea, who were far more vigilant with their testing regimes, noted that the virus had far less impact on younger women - something that the fear mongering media haven\u2019t really covered here, nor, btw, are we hearing the slightest thing about *anyone* who\u2019s had the illness &amp; is now fine &amp; didn\u2019t need a respirator - yet it\u2019s actually the majority.\n\nAnyway back to some numbers - 35 years old isn\u2019t some sort of magic cutoff, so it\u2019s fair to assume that a good 2 million of the healthier, fitter, higher age brackets would be fine (2 million is random but again *extremely* conservative) without the need for treatment. Let\u2019s apply the worst-case projection of 70% infection rate to the remaining 15 million &amp; we\u2019re down to 10 &amp; a half million. Let\u2019s now apply your 5% &amp; we\u2019re getting down towards half a million.

The escalating coronavirus crisis might also make Americans more risk-averse when choosing a leader.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Sanders argues that voters agree with his platform, even if they are skeptical of his candidacy. \u201cPoll after poll\u2026shows that a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda,\u201d he said, in explaining why he would continue his campaign against front-runner Joe Biden, despite two straight weeks of big primary losses and mounting calls for him to drop out and unify the party against Mr. Trump.\n&gt; \n&gt; He vowed to use this Sunday\u2019s debate, the first solely between the two candidates, to press his rival for detailed plans for expanding health care, reducing childhood poverty and curbing the political power of billionaires. The candidates face primaries on Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Sanders\u2019s bid to remake Democratic economic thinking remains one of the most intense conflicts in this election cycle, pitting him against affluent party donors and longtime policy makers who share many of his general goals, but prefer a less government-oriented, or more tempered approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; Surveys indicate a party electorate torn. A February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed 53% of Democratic voters preferred a candidate pushing Sanders-like \u201clarger scale policies that might cost more\u201d and \u201cbring major change,\u201d versus 41% favoring a Biden-like candidate \u201cwho proposes smaller scale policies that\u2026will bring less change.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; But the same poll found Democrats, by 53% to 42%, favored a candidate \u201cwith the best chance to defeat Donald Trump\u201d over one \u201cclosest to your views\u201d\u2014and they have increasingly concluded Mr. Biden has the best chance.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Mr. Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, appeared ascendant last month in the nominating contest, his sweeping platform of national health care, universal free college and a Green New Deal drew blistering criticism from Democratic stalwarts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, a top adviser to both Presidents Clinton and Obama, predicted \u201cmajor adverse consequences\u201d for workers, markets and business investment should Mr. Sanders prevail. Former Obama White House chief economist Jason Furman, also now at Harvard, said the Sanders program would lead to \u201ctoo many individuals too constrained from choices\u201d and \u201ca weaker economy.\u201d The Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington center-left think tank, branded the Sanders platform \u201cfiscal fantasy.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; None of that moved Mr. Sanders to soften his policies. Instead, Mr. Sanders and his aides have blasted the criticism and the critics as tainted and out of touch. They blame moderate Democratic economists and think tanks, as much as Republicans, for long-term wage stagnation and other economic worries still haunting millions of Americans despite the long expansion.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWe need to think outside the box,\u201d said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders\u2019s longtime policy adviser. \u201cOver the past 45 years we\u2019ve seen a massive increase in income and wealth inequality while the working class continues to struggle. It\u2019s too late for establishment economics.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Sanders is more likely to discuss fostering a \u201cmoral economy\u201d than strategies to boost gross domestic product, business investment or corporate profits. With his \u201ceconomic bill of rights,\u201d he wants Washington to guarantee all Americans a job, health insurance, college and housing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many Democratic economists \u201cwould argue those are fine aspirations, but in order to achieve them, you\u2019d have to intervene in markets beyond levels they\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the chief economist in the Obama administration for then-Vice President Biden.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Sanders proposes sharply higher taxes, bigger government spending and more regulation. He would boost the size of the federal government\u2019s share of GDP to a level exceeded only once, during World War II.\n&gt; \n&gt; While many Democrats over the past few decades have tried to balance government intervention with market forces, Mr. Sanders has less trust in the power of markets to improve lives. On Thursday, he said his big-government vision of a national health-care plan and price controls on drug companies would put the country on stronger footing to address crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.\n&gt; \n&gt; At times, he has dismissed cost concerns outright. Asked at a Feb. 18 CNN Las Vegas town hall about the price and feasibility of his plan to phase out fossil fuels, he replied: \u201cYou tell me how much is too much if we\u2019re talking about saving this planet.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Sanders wants to smash the conventional wisdom that he says has constrained thinking in Washington since Ronald Reagan\u2014a consensus that treats higher taxes and new government programs with suspicion\u2014and reopen discussion of liberal ideas that haven\u2019t been seriously considered since the 1970s.\n&gt; \n&gt; The candidate already claims victory on that front, recounting how proposals from his failed 2016 bid, dismissed at the time as too far left, have since been embraced by Democratic party leaders.\n&gt; \n&gt; One fight with Hillary Clinton, who won the 2016 Democratic nomination, was over his push to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Democratic-led House last year passed a bill seeking to make that law, while all his 2020 rival candidates endorsed the goal. Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 proposal for a Wall Street tax on certain financial transactions was also embraced by much of the 2020 field. Mr. Biden\u2019s current positions on many issues, such as expanding the Social Security and Medicare entitlement programs, have moved him closer to Mr. Sanders than the longtime Delaware politician has been for much of his career.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI have been called radical and extreme,\u201d Mr. Sanders said during an Iowa campaign stop last year. \u201cOver the last four years\u2026a whole lot of other people have become radical and extreme.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Even some mainstream center-left economists praise Mr. Sanders\u2019s bid to shake up the Washington consensus on restricting spending. \u201cAll upper-income democracies in the world have much more generous welfare states than the U.S. and do fine,\u201d said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that has long advised both Republican and Democratic administrations. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone so far off the rails in terms of underinvestment in the public sphere that even a massive shift would only get us part way to where we should be,\u201d Mr. Posen said.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Sanders campaign has been the only major one in this election cycle to avoid even talking to top advisers of previous Democratic presidents. Economists who weren\u2019t part of the Clinton or Obama administrations have been close to the Sanders campaign. One is Stephanie Kelton, a professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, N.Y., who served as an aide to Mr. Sanders on the Senate Budget Committee. She is the leading proponent of \u201cmodern monetary theory,\u201d which argues that governments shouldn\u2019t fret over debt and deficits.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another is Darrick Hamilton of Ohio State University, whose work focuses on what he calls \u201ceconomic justice.\u201d He aims to narrow the wealth gap between black and white households and has been a proponent of the federal job guarantee idea that Mr. Sanders has endorsed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Sanders\u2019s wealth tax was written with the help of two French economists at the University of California, Berkeley, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren had a similar plan influenced by their work. Until she dropped out in early March, she was Mr. Sanders\u2019s competitor for the liberal lane in the nominating contest.\n&gt;", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "created_utc": 1584156187, "id": "fkgd2zh", "author": "HaLoGuY007", "link_id": "t3_fic7he", "parent_id": "t3_fic7he", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": true, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "In a somewhat similar light, I had a woman steal my parking spot 2 years ago, and it really stuck with me because of how she reacted right after.\n\nSo I went to UCI for college, and my ex and I went to the Corona del Mar Plaza on Saturday afternoon to shop at Jack's Surfboards and then get some groceries at Bristol Farms. \n\nPlace is packed.
