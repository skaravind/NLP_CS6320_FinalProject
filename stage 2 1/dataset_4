[{"body": "Healthcare workers go in the bunny suits (aka the full hazmat suits) for a few reasons:\n\n1) As others have noted, in general there are shortages of healthcare workers (in many areas, even at the best of times) and you really don't want someone getting sick on the job.\n\n2) In the event there are multiple strains going around (which doesn't seem to be the case for Wuhan-CoV, but in future could be--or can be true for other cruds, too) you don't want those two strains mixing and swapping genetic material through recombination and making a potentially nastier \"hybrid virus\".\n\n3) Hospital workers also go around in the bunny suits to prevent what's called \"nosocomial infections\"--that is, infections spread to people who were not sick with Wuhan-CoV but were in hospital for different reasons altogether.\n\n4) As amazing as it may sound...hospitals with infectious disease wards do all of this for *any particularly nasty contagious disease, including measles and the chickenpox.*  (Yes, the children's hospital chain in my area--we have three children's hospitals--actually has a small infectious disease ward.  With negative airflow rooms and HEPA filters.  And staff will go in with bunny suits, particularly if it's something without a good vaccine.  And yes, that includes Dat Flu.  You know the one.  *Dat Flu.*)\n\nIn a home environment...typically you're not veritably marinating yourself in infectious material (including droplets coughed by multiple people with the blerg, much less Icky Bodily Fluids) for upwards of eight to sixteen hours a day (and the latter is more likely with ER staff--many of whom are interns on rotations--or during a public health emergency  like an epidemic).  You're generally dealing with one to two, maybe three, sick people.  You're not dealing with the possibility of multiple strains of the Blerg effectively Having Microbiological Nookie.  You're generally not having to worry about spreading the crud to others as much.\n\nAnd since you're in a home environment, and you can always Disinfect The Things with some bleach wipes or Lysol...you don't need to go for the full bunny suit.  (Besides, those things are expensive!)  You likely don't have a \"clean room\" where you can pretty much do a full change of clothing and someone to help you into and out of said bunny suit (hospitals do).\n\n(Now, if you DO have a pre-existing condition like diabetes or asthma, or are on cancer chemo or take certain drugs to prevent organ rejection or to manage diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or Crohn's Disease...yes, I'd do a consult with your medical professionals that help you manage this stuff, to the effect of \"What should I add to my treatment action plan to prevent Wuhan-CoV, and what should I do if I suspect I've contracted it?\"  Which is a good idea anyways, and the advice is probably going to be the same as preventing really bad colds or flu in a year where the flu shot isn't as effective as usual.)", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1580188148, "id": "ffspnvu", "author": "kusuriurikun", "link_id": "t3_eux7e5", "parent_id": "t1_ffs430t", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": true, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "MS: Hanks 3/17 IG post with the infamous Corona Type Writer mentioned Flatten the Curve in relation to Gin Tummy and a score of 201 that isn't possible in that game.

R. Spiegel, MD, MSHS, co\u2013editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Gastroenterology.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"If you leave out anorexia, which is very nonspecific, the percentage of COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms is about 30%,\" Spiegel told Medscape Medical News.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lei Pan, MD, PhD, of Binzhou Medical University Hospital in Binzhou, China, and colleagues in the Wuhan Medical Treatment Expert Group conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study on 204 patients who had polymerase chain reaction\u2013confirmed COVID-19 at three hospitals in Hubei province from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. The team considered clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ninety-nine patients (48.5%) presented to the hospital with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint. Most of these patients did not have underlying digestive diseases. Their symptoms included anorexia (83.8%), diarrhea (29.3%), vomiting (0.8%), and abdominal pain (0.4%).\n&gt; \n&gt; Like Spiegel, David A. Johnson, MD, professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at the Eastern Virginia School of Medicine in Norfolk, says that the patients with anorexia should be excluded. A more realistic \u2015 if high \u2015 estimate is the 29% who presented with diarrhea, Johnson says.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Other GI problems \u2015 abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting \u2015 may raise the percentage slightly from the 29%,\" Johnson said.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the overall study population, Pan and colleagues found that the average time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8.1 days. However, it was 9.0 days for patients with GI symptoms, including those with anorexia, compared with 7.3 days for those who did not have digestive symptoms. Seven patients had digestive symptoms but no respiratory symptoms at admission.\n&gt; \n&gt; Digestive symptoms appeared to be tied to worse outcomes. Whereas 60% of patients without digestive symptoms recovered and were discharged, only 34.3% of the patients with digestive symptoms recovered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiegel explained how the digestive symptoms arise. \"The virus enters human cells through the ACE2 receptor in the lungs but also in other body parts, including the GI tract. We think the virus gets into saliva and we swallow it, and then it passes through the acid layer in some patients and uses the ACE2 receptors to enter epithelial cells that line the intestine.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The virus replicates rapidly in the cells of the GI lining, enters the intestinal tract, and is shed, Spiegel said. \"There is clear evidence from endoscopy that it can damage the stomach and the intestines. The fact that these patients do worse may be that more of the body is involved.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; An explanation for the longer time between symptom onset and COVID-19 diagnosis might be that patients with only GI symptoms or mild respiratory complaints did not think that they could have the coronavirus.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"When the patients were admitted to the hospital, no one yet knew they had COVID-19. Almost half, when asked why they were there, mentioned a digestive problem. They may have also had a respiratory symptom, like a cough or shortness of breath, but that's not what they said was their main complaint,\" Spiegel told Medscape Medical News.\n&gt; \n&gt; The authors conclude, \"Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, may be a presenting feature of COVID-19, and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms rather than waiting for respiratory symptoms to emerge.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiegel points out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to include GI symptoms in their guidance, although recommendations are changing rapidly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiegel urges caution in evaluating patients with only GI symptoms. \"A large part of the population has diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting regularly, so it's clearly impossible and irresponsible to start testing everyone with diarrhea for COVID-19. But if somebody has new fever and diarrhea and suspects they may have had contact with a patient or carrier, I'd want to test them.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Limitations of the study include a relatively small sample, the retrospective design, and not testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool.", "subreddit": "COVID19", "created_utc": 1584840239, "id": "fl5mert", "author": "wataf", "link_id": "t3_fmq6bb", "parent_id": "t3_fmq6bb", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "From the link:\n\nGood evening. If you are tagged in this you are family, or very close to my family. I hope that you will take my words to heart and listen.\n\nI have been in healthcare all my life, and now, over 30 years in I am now an ICU nurse practitioner dealing with critical illness and life support issues. Those of you who have come to me for advice in the past know that I am a straight shooter and i have never bullshitted you on matters of health. With that in mind....here we go.\n\nCOVID19 is here. In America. NOW. Circulating in communities, both detected and undetected. There is no stopping it. COVID19 is a respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV2, a new (novel is the scientific word) strain of coronavirus that has emerged in humans since December 2019. It is related to the SARS virus that circulated in 2002-3. We got lucky then. Our luck is not so good this time.\n\nIt is not the flu. It doesn't feel like the flu. And it is deadlier than the flu by every measure we have undertaken in affected countries. It will make the rounds and many of us will catch it. Most of us wont have a problem with it however... a significant number of us will get fairly sick and may need hospitalization... of those about half of those hospitalized will likely end up in the ICU and possibly on breathing machines... and of those sickest, there will be deaths. COVID19 at its best is showing a 0.8% mortality rate, which is 3x worse than the flu. That is in countries that have extensive testing and detected both the well AND unwell who are positive for the SARS-CoV2 virus, which causes the COVID19 illness.\n\nThere are 350 million folks in america, roughly. People are throwing around this number of \"less than one percent\". Well let me tell you: Do the math. A very small percentage of a very large number is STILL a large number.\n\nSymptoms of the Flu involve your body feeling like everything hurts, and you got run over by a mack truck and you just feel awful.. in addition to upper respiratory symptoms.\n\nCOVID19 is different. You may or may not have a runny nose and fever. A sore throat becomes a major common finding.. then it gets in the lungs. A dry, nonproductive cough is common, followed or accompanied by shortness of breath. The shortness of breath is what is triggering hospital visits, and the folks presenting to the hospitals show low oxygen levels (oxygen saturations) and chest imaging typically shows a bilateral diffuse pneumonia (Double pneumonia for the laypeople).\n\nThe only proven effective therapies are supportive- Oxygen, and positive pressure ventilation... either with a cpap/bipap machine or with a mechanical ventilator attached to a breathing tube. There is no cure. Your body has to fight it off and it has to run its course. There is no Tamiflu equivalent that works for this. There are some smart medical folks out there spitballing some ideas, but nothing is proven to work. So like every other viral illness you have gotten, you have to ride it out and hope your body is strong enough.\n\nBabies and children are making out fairly Ok.. even if they test positive they havent been dying of it in China, in Italy... however healthy young adults, even athletic types, in their 30's-50's are coming in very sick and some are dying. From there, the older one is, the higher the hospitalization rates and the mortality rates.\n\nInformation out of China shows that it was killing men more than women, but one thing to note is that in China, older men are invariably tobacco smokers. Information out of Italy appears to show the obese are having a worse time with it. In general, blood pressure and diabetes are associated with higher rates of severe illness and death. In particular, people takeing ACE Inhibitors or ARB's for their blood pressure (the drugs ending in \"pril\" like lisinopril, or \"sartan\" like valsartan) seem to be having a worse time. This makes sense since both of these classes of medicine affect cells in the lungs, which SARS CoV2 is thought to also affect.\n\nThe biggest danger right now, and the reason why I am writing this, and tagging you... is that this will \"explode\" here like it has in Italy, Iran and how it did in China.\n\nWe only have so many hospital beds. We only have so many ICU beds. We only have so many ventilators.. and we only have so many trained staff who can care for the patients. If this blows up massively beyond the ability of the health care system to treat and rescue patients, people who COULD have lived will simply die.\n\nIn italy they have an excellent national healthcare system with about 5000 ICU beds, and per capita have more doctors and hospital beds than we do here in the US. Of course, the US is bigger and has more total beds, and ventilators... but again.. less per capita. In italy, in Lombardy (the state/province) and in Milan... they have simply run out of ventilators. Doctors are faced with having too many people who cant breathe anymore, and not enough breathing machines to put them on. They are literally deciding on the spot who might live and who will die. They aren't doing CPR or anything else futile for the COVID patients. They dont have the staff or capacity to do so.\n\nThere's a lot more horrible stuff I could tell you about whats happening, but the short version is this - if we exceed the capacity to manage this, people who should have lived will die.\n\nWhich brings us to here, now, in the US. COVID is here. It WILL sweep the nation. There was never anything we could have done to stop it because of the way we live and conduct business. BUT what we have to do is SLOW IT DOWN.\n\nIF we SLOW IT DOWN, so that the number of unwell and critically ill dont explode, and overwhelm the system, then everyone has a fighting chance. Give time for flu season to end and get flu patients out of the hospital. Give time for the first wave of Covid patients to get well enough to get out of the hospital.\n\nSo.. to SLOW IT DOWN... practice frequent handwashing. Dont touch your face, nose or eyes without washing your hands first. Frequently disinfect common surfaces.\n\nPRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING. COVID LOVES A CROWD. If you are gonna spread this disease around lets spread it to only one or two people not 100 people at a time. Stay away from large groups. Lets lay off the rodeos, the ball games, the big parties, the night clubs. Do small groups.. or stay home. If you go out, and touch common surfaces, clean your hands before touching your face. On a bus in china, one person gave it to 8 other people, including one who got on 30 mins after the index case left the bus.\n\nIf you are sick, stay home. Dont visit other vulnerable folks. If it gets in your household, accept that its there and try not to give it to your aunts, uncles and grandparents. Stay home, dont go to school.\n\nFor the elders reading this. I need you to stay home as if your life depends on it. Because it very well does. Your age group is the one having the worst time with this. And if it gets bad, all I can say is that in Italy this week, if you were crashing and over 60, they didn't even consider offering a vent to them. So please, elders, Stay home, skip church, avoid visiting large numbers of people. Skip the lodge meeting . And if you are adamant that your wings will not be clipped, then please make sure your will is updated, and you've given a copy to your kids.\n\nNow.. none of this says \"panic\" or \"buy bottled water and toilet paper\". I'm asking for everyone to take a deep breath and be smart.\n\nQuit caring about your 401k. In a year or two it will be back. The airlines and cruise lines will get bailed out. The economy is going to tank no matter what, so quit worrying about it. Right now the decision is do we want a tanked economy with a low body count or a high body count.\n\nWe are all in this together. Wash your hands. Cover your mouth. Practice social distancing. Stay away from large crowds. Be smart. Stay home if sick. Dont hoard or steal medical supplies.

He then laid out steps residents can take to help prevent the spread of the virus, like exercising good hygiene, while assuring them that the city had enough supplies of enough goods.\n\nMoreover, he reassured Singaporeans that the virus didn\u2019t appear as deadly as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, meaning that most people would likely experience a minor illness. He also said the government would change its approach if the virus became widespread to avoid overwhelming hospitals, adding he would keep them \u201cinformed every step of the way.\u201d\n\n\nThe speech,\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media in three languages, appeared to have an immediate impact: The long queues at supermarkets throughout the city-state on Friday night returned to normal levels as of Sunday. That alone proved notable in a region where governments have struggled to get the message right, spurring panic buying and confusion over how to protect themselves from the outbreak.\n\nMixed Messages\n\nIn Hong Kong, leader Carrie Lam\u2019s mixed messages on wearing masks and shutting the border with mainland China has stirred mistrust. Nurses have gone on strike and residents have violently opposed quarantine sites, while residents have struggled to buy toilet paper, hand sanitizer, rice and other staples for more than a week.\n\nIn Thailand, meanwhile, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul issued an\u00a0apology\u00a0after saying foreigners should be \u201ckicked out of Thailand\u201d for refusing to wear face masks.\n\nSingapore, which has 5.7 million people, has 45 confirmed cases of the virus. That\u2019s the second-highest outside China, excluding a quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan.\n\nLee's speech \u201cwas a pretty outstanding example of very good risk communication,\u201d said\u00a0Claire Hooker, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney\u2019s Center for Values, Ethics and the Law in Medicine, who has studied the public responses to epidemics and infectious disease for about 20 years. \u201cIt gave people very concrete actions\u201d that \u201chanded back a measure of control to people whose sense of control will\u00a0feel\u00a0threatened,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nThomas Abraham, author of \u201cTwenty First Century Plague, the Story of SARS,\u201d and a risk communication consultant for the\u00a0World Health Organization, said the speech worked because of the high level of trust Singaporeans have in the competence of the government -- as well as the transparency.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Lee does not hide any facts,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cNor does he hesitate to talk about how the situation might worsen.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s next general election must be held by April 2021, though the ruling party has called for early polls in recent cycles.

The Dutch Society for Medical Microbiology (NVMM) writes this in a letter to RIVM today, after the announcement of additional measures across the country. They call for \"military decisive structures\".\n\n\"Stoneware what the cabinet has now done, because this was necessary, \" said Professor Heiman Wertheim, board member of the NVMM. But it may not be enough. \"The situation is urgent. There must be good information. Because the problem is bigger. There is no idea who is in intensive care, who has been admitted, who has recovered and was fired healthy.\" The organization wants to help RIVM with this.\n\nThe doctors have studied data of the virus from other sources and conclude that information on the RIVM site is \"seriously behind and incomplete\". \"The RIVM data give the impression that Brabant is not very different from Utrecht and that the increase in the number of cases is not that bad. We all know that this is not the case.\"\n\n**Drastic measures**\n\nThe doctors blame RIVM for not testing sufficiently for corona contacts. They also want RIVM to make the problems visible by making tables on the site with overviews of newly identified cases and suspicious (untested) cases, how many people have been admitted and are in intensive care and information about the number of deaths, recovered and tested cases.\n\nThe NVMM expects the Netherlands to follow the trend in Italy. \"Significant actions in Italy seem to have an effect now, but have started too late, as indicated by Italy,\" the letter said. The doctors write that not acting now will eventually lead to more damage. \"Only drastic measures in the initial phase can limit the risk for citizens.\"\n\n**Stay alert**\n\nThe doctors also want supplies for diagnosis to be centrally controlled and upgraded. \"There is now a shortage of nasal masks and protective equipment.\" It is difficult to estimate whether the new measures are sufficient. \"It is important that the government has now taken important steps in measures. And it is important that we remain alert from now on.\"\n\n\"Everyone must adhere to the announced new measures.

Scientists at USAMRID, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious diseases, work with some of the most deadly forms of life on earth, killer viruses. Learn more.\n\nSome viruses are picky about which door they choose, but others are a little more promiscuous. \u201cThey can very easily penetrate into all types of cells,\u201d says Anna Suk-Fong Lok, assistant dean for clinical research at the University of Michigan Medical School and former president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.\n\nBoth SARS and MERS viruses can access the cells that line your intestines and large and small colon, and those infections appear to flourish in the gut, potentially causing the damage or the leakage of fluid that becomes diarrhea.\n\nBut Frieman says we don\u2019t know yet if the novel coronavirus does the same. Researchers believe COVID-19 uses the same receptor as SARS, and this doorway can be found in your lungs and small intestines.\n\nTwo studies\u2014one in the New England Journal of Medicine and one preprint in medRxiv involving 1,099 cases\u2014have also detected the virus in stool samples, which might indicate the virus could spread via feces. But this is far from conclusive.\n\n\u201cWhether that kind of fecal transmission is occuring for this Wuhan virus, we don\u2019t know at all,\u201d Frieman says. \u201cBut it definitely looks like it\u2019s there in the stool and it looks like people do have GI symptoms associated with this.\u201d\n\nBlood storm\n\nCoronaviruses can also cause problems in other systems of the body, due to the hyperactive immune response we mentioned earlier.\n\nA 2014 study showed that 92 percent of patients with MERS had at least one manifestation of the coronavirus outside of the lungs. In fact, signs of a full body blitz have been witnessed with all three of the zoonotic coronaviruses: elevated liver enzymes, lower white blood cell and platelet count, and low blood pressure. In rare cases, patients have suffered from acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t necessarily a sign that the virus itself is spreading throughout the body, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and associate research scientist at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. It might be a cytokine storm.\n\n   Basically you\u2019re bleeding out of your blood vessels.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, virologist\n\nCytokines are proteins used by the immune system as alarm beacons\u2014they recruit immune cells to the site of infection. The immune cells then kill off the infected tissue in a bid to save the rest of the body.\n\nHumans rely on our immune systems to keep their cool when facing a threat. But during a runaway coronavirus infection, when the immune system dumps cytokines into the lungs without any regulation, this culling becomes a free-for-all, Rasmussen says \u201cInstead of shooting at a target with a gun, you\u2019re using a missile launcher,\u201d she says. That\u2019s where the problem arises: Your body is not just targeting the infected cells. It is attacking healthy tissue too.\n\nThe implications extend outside the lungs. Cytokine storms create inflammation that weakens blood vessels in the lungs and causes fluid to seep through to the air sacs. \u201cBasically you\u2019re bleeding out of your blood vessels,\u201d Rasmussen says. The storm spills into your circulatory system and creates systemic issues across multiple organs.\n\nFrom there, things can take a sharp turn for the worse. In some of the most severe COVID-19 cases, the cytokine response\u2014combined with a diminished capacity to pump oxygen to the rest of the body\u2014can result in multi-organ failure. Scientists don\u2019t know exactly why some patients experience complications outside of the lung, but it might be linked to underlying conditions like heart disease or diabetes.\n\n\u201cEven if the virus doesn\u2019t get to kidneys and liver and spleen and other things, it can have clear downstream effects on all of those processes,\u201d Frieman says. And that\u2019s when things can get serious.\n\nToday\u2019sPopular Stories\n\nScienceStarstruck\n\nThe first person to see the 'Pale Blue Dot' image still has it stashed in her closet\n\nAnimals\n\nWorld\u2019s largest cave fish discovered in India\n\nScience\n\nA huge iceberg just broke off West Antarctica\u2019s most endangered glacier\n\nLiver: Collateral damage\n\nWhen a zoonotic coronavirus spreads from the respiratory system, your liver is often one downstream organ that suffers. Doctors have seen indications of liver injury with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19\u2014often mild, though more severe cases have led to severe liver damage and even liver failure. So what\u2019s happening?\n\n\u201cOnce a virus gets into your bloodstream, they can swim to any part of your body,\u201d Lok says. \u201cThe liver is a very vascular organ so \\[a coronavirus\\] can very easily get into your liver.\u201d\n\nYour liver works pretty hard to make sure your body can function properly. Its main job is to process your blood after it leaves the stomach, filtering out the toxins and creating nutrients your body can use. It also makes the bile that helps your small intestine break down fats. Your liver also contains enzymes, which speed up chemical reactions in the body.\n\nIn a normal body, Lok explains, liver cells are constantly dying off and releasing enzymes into your bloodstream. This resourceful organ then quickly regenerates new cells and carries on with its day. Because of that regeneration process, the liver can withstand a lot of injury.\n\nWhen you have abnormally high levels of enzymes in your blood, though\u2014as has been a common characteristic of patients suffering from SARS and MERS\u2014it\u2019s a warning sign. It might be a mild injury that the liver will quickly bounce back from or it could be something more severe\u2014even liver failure.\n\nLok says scientists don\u2019t completely understand how these respiratory viruses behave in the liver. The virus might be directly infecting the liver, replicating and killing off the cells itself. Or those cells might be collateral damage as your body\u2019s immune response to the virus sets off a severe inflammatory reaction in the liver.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1581740059, "id": "fho3a5r", "author": "UndercoverRussianBot", "link_id": "t3_f43bh7", "parent_id": "t1_fho38v9", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "If supportive care alone isn\u2019t sufficient, then experimental use of these drugs is the common treatment right now. \nSometimes alone, more often in combination from the research I have been reading. \n\nWith the already approved drugs used off label to treat COVID-19 all that is required is patient or patient proxy consent as the drugs are already approved for medical use. \nMost will also be asked (sometimes retrospectively) if their case data can be used as part of clinical trial data for use in analysis later which can then become part of the body of evidence that these drugs are indeed effective. \nWhat will currently be lacking is the size of the control group, the severely with COVID-19 that may benefit from these drugs but are not given them, mostly patient refusal currently as currently if your only option is Chloroquine and Supportive ICU care or very likely worsening disease and death, most consent to Chloroquine even though it isn\u2019t approved for that indication and the evidence for safety and efficient is not as large (as yet) as would be normally needed for approval. \n\nFor unapproved drugs like Remdesivir, compassionate use authorisation and consent are needed making its use much less common as there isn\u2019t a great supply of it and qualifying for compassionate use requires meeting a set of criteria that not everyone that may benefit from it can meet. \n\nAnything saying \u201890% success rate\u2019 should not be taken as confirmatory proof of efficacy. Samples are still to small and those sort of statements would have to be combined with what sort of condition the patients treated were in to begin with.   \nAnd also no, it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re saving 90% of COVID patients because of the 90% efficacy of some drug treatment - it also is not in any way connected to the published rate of cases being classed as severe nor those ending in death vs recovery. \n\nAny paper regarding a specified drug treatment for COVID right now is simply communicating how cases progressed when these drugs were used. \nThey don\u2019t indicate that the drugs were curative or disease modifying as there is no way to determine how many of the patients treated experimentally with drugs would not have recovered spontaneously. \nHowever the more examples of cases you collect with patients in similar conditions where the group treated had a lower mortality rate than the group given no antiviral drugs adds to the body of evidence for the specified drugs that they were partly responsible for that lower mortality rate (should it be lower). \n\nAnd as with all scientific literature, there are biases. Particularly when a problem needs a solution as quickly as possible. \nThere is more pressure to publish when the report can be written presenting data as showing that the experimental drug treatments lessened disease length and/or severity, reduced morbidity and/or mortality and even very low sample size case reports of one or two critically ill COVID-19, ventilator/ECMO dependent patients being brought back from the bring of death very rapidly once drug treatment was initiated. \nSo you\u2019ll see a lot of positive confirmation bias around drugs that do have an positive effect against SARS-CoV2. \nIt\u2019s not the best science, but it\u2019s not totally without use and until better double blind controlled trials are available (which can be partially completed during the outbreak with severe restriction on control groups and the double blinding); it\u2019s these case reports that are guiding the production of preliminary treatment protocols all around the world. \nRead any country\u2019s current guidelines for pharmacotherapy in COVID-19 and you\u2019ll see referenced case reports of low numbers of patients given Chloroquine and Kaletra while in the ICU on renal replacement and ventilated rather than large controlled trials also including healthy controls as that\u2019s mainly all we currently have. So these positive outcomes shouldn\u2019t be ignored but their guiding of treatment for large groups will be replaced with better studies once available which will also provide better evidence as to the efficacy of these drugs and the rates of efficacy such as something that resembles a \u2018success rate\u2019 - \n\nData from better trials will show differences between drug treated and untreated COVID patients (if they exist for a particular drug treatment) \nThey will include many more data points/large sample sizes such as differences in mortality rates, rate of reduction of viral load (viral load vs time in treated and untreated), CRP level vs time in treated and untreated patients. \nOther trends may be present which one may be able to find from larger studies such as differences in drug efficacy between age groups, sex, combined with other drugs, combined with comorbidities. \nStatistical analysis of the data will then allow reports to be produced to show if and how significant the changes to the measured and recorded clinical attributes (blood results, data obtained upon physical examination etc) are. \nDo this correctly, and in a manner that can be repeated, and you build a body of evidence for a particular drug treatment that increases confidence that a correlation between improvement in clinical condition and use of a new drug regiment is indicative of a causation.\n\nWith all the clinical data present, a probable confirmation on the downstream effects of a mechanism of action - if you know from in vitro work that a drug inhibits an enzyme required for viral replication and patients that receive it have their viral load inversely correlated with time using of the drug and the rate of decrease is much greater in patients using the drug you start to build a better quantitative picture of efficacy as one example. You can also use these data combined with drug dose given as an independent variable in order to determine the optimal dose for each age group or minimal dose required to treat which could be (and very probably is) different for COVID than malaria. \n\nSo be very wary of wide reaching statements during this early stage especially those that state things like cure and success rates with no explanation of how that number was calculated and from data from what sample of patients were used to generate it and the number in that sample and of course whether the process has been peer reviewed and repeated by other medics/scientists/healthcare providers. \n\nTL;DR - Use of these drugs experimentally is already common in severe cases as it\u2019s all we have to use, there aren\u2019t yet any specific SARS-CoV2 antiviral drugs. \n90% success rate with a drug doesn\u2019t mean that we are currently saving 90% of patients with COVID-19 because of that drug. \nThere is not yet enough data to provide any \u2018success rate\u2019 type statistics or even change in mortality rate statistics for any drug used in COVID-19 patients but there are many interesting and encouraging case reports where drugs have been used against SARS-CoV2 which are being used to generate preliminary guidelines for clinical practice and will guide the construction of larger current and future studies that will show how confident we can be that any of these treatments can be relied upon to treat COVID-19 and then which are better than others by comparing different drug treatments that all positively treat the disease with each other. \nThen we will have evidence for which treatments work, the correct doses to use, which are most toxic/have more side effects, which are more or less appropriate in special populations (in pregnancy, users of other meds etc) and in which cases a drug treatment is effective against the disease in some cases (those currently classed as \u2018severe\u2019 for example, something else we need a universal definition for) but didn\u2019t statistically significantly change the outcome in others, ie when use of antiviral drug treatment (which does work) is required or appropriate at all. \n\nI\u2019ve probably missed a lot out, but there some useful info in there. One could write (and there exist many) large texts on how to construct and run a clinical trial that produces high enough quantity and quality data that can be used to produce evidence to guide clinical practice. \nYou also get the picture of why it all takes much time, financial investment and dedicated personnel to do correctly. Drugs are very expensive because of profiteering, but they\u2019re normally expensive and time consuming to discover and prove safe and effective because of all the above and more.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584606775, "id": "fkwut7j", "author": "CaptainFentanyl", "link_id": "t3_fkji15", "parent_id": "t1_fktvhp1", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "I hate crying in public.\nBut there I was \u2014 17 weeks pregnant with my first child \u2014 with tears streaming down my face as I stood among a crowd of anxious shoppers in a Long Beach Target.

Women experience physiological changes during pregnancy that can weaken their immune systems and place them at higher risk for severe complications if exposed to viruses, especially if they have underlying heath conditions.\nPast studies have shown that pregnant women who contract influenza are at higher risk for severe complications, and in 2009, women who contracted H1N1 \u2014 the swine flu \u2014 during pregnancy also became sicker than non-pregnant women, according to Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at the Emory University School of Medicine in Georgia.\nStill, doctors said that researchers have not seen early signals suggesting an increased risk of complications or birth defects associated with pregnant women and fetuses exposed to the coronavirus.\n\u201cPregnant women can become severely ill, but I think pregnant women should be reassured as there doesn\u2019t seem to be related birth defects like we saw with Zika,\u201d Jamieson said during a phone call last week. \u201cThese are scary times, and I think a lot of people, including pregnant women, are afraid. Luckily this is not a virus that seems to disproportionately affect pregnant women. They can take solace in that.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a recent study published in\u00a0the Lancet, researchers followed nine pregnant women who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China \u2014 the epicenter of the outbreak \u2014 during their third trimester. Researchers found that none of the infants, all delivered via caesarean, had the virus at birth. There also was no evidence of the virus in the mothers\u2019 breast milk, cord blood or amniotic fluid, according to the study.\nThe new mothers had experienced the same symptoms as nonpregnant women, the study showed, with fever in seven, cough in four, myalgia in three and sore throat and malaise in two. They developed pneumonia, but none of the cases were considered severe.\nResearchers suggest these data indicate that mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 do not pass along the virus to their unborn babies through the placenta. However, it is possible for mothers to pass the virus to infants after birth from respiratory droplets or particles that leave the mouth or nose when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks.\nWhile the virus has not been detected in breast milk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it\u2019s still not clear whether the virus can be transmitted to infants during feedings. The CDC recommends infected mothers wash their hands before touching their babies and wearing a face mask, if possible, while breastfeeding. Another option is having a healthy person feed expressed breast milk to the infant.\nHealth officials are urging pregnant women, along with the elderly and others with weakened immune systems, to do their best to avoid exposure to the coronavirus. Doctors suggest staying home as much as possible, avoiding crowds \u2014 including long lines at supermarkets and other stores \u2014 and staying away from emergency rooms. And, of course, frequent hand washing.\n\nDr. Karin Nielsen-Saines, professor of clinical pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at UCLA Children\u2019s Hospital, suggests women reach out to their doctors to see if routine labs or physical assessments can be done without a visit to clinics or hospitals to limit their risk of exposure.\nSome doctors, including mine, have already instituted this practice. The Kaiser Permanente in Gardena was nearly empty when I arrived Wednesday afternoon for a monthly exam and ultrasound. Medical staff wearing paper gowns, masks and gloves screened patients for symptoms of the virus before they walked in the front door.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI was one of a few people that day who had to physically visit the office because I had to have blood drawn.\n\u201cGet in and out quickly,\u201d a nurse told me as she placed a sticker allowing my entry into the building on my blouse.\nAnother woman who was having an ultrasound was video-chatting with her husband, who was stuck in the lobby, during the exam. The medical center has stopped allowing visitors in exam rooms in an effort to help protect patients and staff members from the spread of the illness.\nA similar visitor policy also extends to hospitals when women are giving birth. Kaiser will allow one visitor, typically a spouse or partner, for the duration of a woman\u2019s hospital stay. But family and friends are being asked to wait until the new parents are at home to meet their bundle of joy. Hoag Hospital in Orange County has also instituted the one-visitor policy.\nDespite the new restrictions and disappointments \u2014 especially for women whose baby shower plans and \u201cbabymoon\u201d trips have been thwarted by the virus \u2014 Nielsen-Saines emphasized the importance of keeping to a routine, even during times of uncertainty.\n\u201cExercise, talk with friends, try to keep a sense of normalcy,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis feeling of impending doom doesn\u2019t help anyone.

Fourteen people tested positive in the town of Codogno, southeast of Milan, and two others in Padua, in the Veneto region, according to the latest information. These are the first known cases of transmission by contagion of this disease in the country. This situation has led to the compulsory quarantine of about 250 people and the isolation of ten neighbouring towns with a total of about 47,500 inhabitants. In addition, the regional government has forced the closure of all public premises and has recommended that the inhabitants do not leave their homes in the next few hours. The medical alarm has also been triggered by the lack of clarity regarding the source of the infection and the epidemiological link that would allow the disease to be isolated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first case detected was that of a 38-year-old Italian man from Castiglione d'Adda. The patient was hospitalised on Wednesday, but initially no clear connection to China was established and it was ruled out that the symptoms could be related to the disease. When his situation worsened and he had to be transferred to the intensive care unit, his wife gave the alert that activated the protocol: the man had met several times with a friend who had recently returned from China. But the clue was more puzzling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe meetings between the two occurred many more days after his return from the Asian country. More than the 14 that establish the duration of the incubation process and that could hide the symptoms. In addition, when the potential carrier of the virus was tested, he tested negative. The man remains hospitalized for further testing, but he never had any symptoms and if he actually contracted the virus, his infection could be over by now, health authorities suggested. The worst-case scenario, hence the alarm raised in the region, is that the epidemiological link would have been lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe wife, who is eight months pregnant, was one of those who tested positive for the coronavirus, as was a man who had played sports with it. The rest of the infections did not, in principle, have direct contact with the 38-year-old man. Three customers from a bar in Codogno, the main focus of the infection in Lombardy, all arrived at the local hospital between Thursday and Friday night with significant cases of pneumonia, which made it possible to detect the positives. \"The patients are men and women, all around 40 years old. The only thing we know is that they all live in the same area,\" said Giulio Gallera, regional health coordinator. However, eight other people in Lombardy were added to the list of infections, including five doctors and three patients from the Codogno hospital where the first people to contract the virus were treated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe environment of the man who was first infected has been isolated. The patient works at an Italian branch of Unilever, while the friend who made the trip to China is a manager at MAE, an Italian producer of synthetic fibres. Among those who should be quarantined are the 38-year-old's co-workers, family members and the doctors and nurses who treated him in the hospital.

Italy has the worst outbreak in Europe, with more than 7,300 known to be infected.\n\nMany, including Mr. Conte, have appealed to Italians to reject their tendency toward \u201cfurbizia,\u201d the Italian word for the sort of cunning or cleverness typically channeled into getting around bureaucracy and inconvenient laws.\n\nFurbizia, to be sure, is a broad-brush character trait ascribed to Italians, often by other Italians.\n\nBut on Sunday, it seemed to be front of mind as travelers rushed onto trains out of Lombardy before the decree went into effect in the afternoon and as health experts and officials implored the public to abide by the law and act responsibly.\n\n\u201cYou need to stay home!\u201d Barbara Balanzoni, a doctor, said in a video that went viral in Italy. She said there were not enough respirators to help people sick from the virus.\n\n\u201cThere are too many people walking around,\u201d Dr. Balanzoni protested.\n\nAs museums closed across the country, Italy\u2019s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, thanked \u201cthe many protagonists of music, cinema, and show business\u201d who promoted on social media the \u201cI\u2019m Staying Home\u201d hashtag.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important message for our youth,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn Rome, outside the locked-down \u201cred zones\u201d farther north, the authorities recommended that people limit their movements to only what is \u201cstrictly necessary.\u201d Valeria Graziussi, a Neapolitan living in Rome, said she and her friends had decided to \u201cdo an experiment.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, she went for an afternoon coffee at the Caf\u00e9 Sant\u2019Eustachio, one of the city\u2019s best-known cafes, which is usually packed. \u201cYou rarely get to stand at the counter for more than 30 seconds,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Graziussi still found lines to get served at the counter, and so considered the experiment a success.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been terrorized enough,\u201d her friend Davide d\u2019Andrea said with a shrug.\n\nThe Italian authorities have consistently taken some of the most aggressive steps to stop the virus\u2019s spread. They have canceled flights from China in January, quarantining entire towns in February and now severely limiting movement in all of Lombardy \u2014 home to the economic powerhouse Milan \u2014 as well as in swaths of other nearby regions and iconic cities like Venice.\n\nThat has not been enough for some European officials. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis, said on Sunday that Italy should ban all its citizens from traveling to Europe.\n\nIn Italy, critics said the calls for civic duty were undercut by confusion.\n\nThey said that contradictory messages from the government and from officials of the northern regions about what people could do and where they could go were not helping. They also criticized the national government in Rome for a schizophrenia that vacillates between drop-everything alerts and just-wash-your-hands reassurances.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Conte said Italians were \u201cobligated\u201d to stay put in the demarcated northern areas unless they had been granted permission to pass through police checkpoints, the Lombardy official running the region\u2019s response to the crisis said it was not so strict.\n\nGiulio Gallera, the Lombardy region\u2019s top health care official, said in a Facebook live post that the decree signed overnight by Mr. Conte had fostered \u201cdoubts\u201d among citizens. Mr. Gallera suggested that citizens, to preserve the country\u2019s economy, should be able to move around for work. And he said the national government should clear up any confusion on the matter.\n\nMatteo Salvini, the leader of Italy\u2019s opposition league party, echoed the sentiment.\n\n\u201cClarity, clarity, clarity!\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWho can do what? Where can you go? What can you bring?\u201d\n\nIn the days before the decree, old men outside the quarantined town Zorlesco joked that their friends often sidestepped the rules and eluded the police checkpoints by taking old country roads to the bar for a drink outside the locked-down area.\n\nIn the country\u2019s southern regions, the governors say that anyone arriving from locked- down northern areas should go into quarantine.\n\nGiuseppe Ippolito, the director of the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome, declared on Italian television that \u201cthe people who fled last night are a potential risk for the country.\u201d He urged them to contact the health services, report their situation and \u201cbe ready for eventual isolation.\u201d\n\nSome people thought they were doing the right thing by leaving Milan for the south.\n\nAt Milan\u2019s Central train station early Sunday morning, Giorgia Caredda, a 30-year-old social media manager, waited for a train to Rome so that she could help take care of her father, who has heart problems, \u201cin case something bad happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne side of me feels really silly\u201d she said about being prompted to leave by a sense of impending doom. \u201cI got this sensation of being chained and needed to get out.\u201d\n\nThe authorities in the Lazio region, where the regional president on Saturday said he had contracted the virus, posted on Facebook pictures of busy squares and streets in Rome with a #wecantdothis caption.\n\nIn Luigi Barzini\u2019s 1964 classic study of his countrymen, \u201cThe Italians,\u201d he attributed the value put on furbizia to Italy\u2019s habit of being conquered and governed by a long line of hated foreigners or quislings, from Napoleon to the Hapsburgs.\n\nImage\n\nA checkpoint in the quarantined town Zorlesco.Credit...Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times\n\u201cUnder the surface the Italians invented ways to defeat oppressive regimentation,\u201d Mr. Barzini wrote. \u201cAs they could not protect their national liberty in the field of battle, they fought strenuously to defend the liberty of the individual and his family, the only liberty they understood anyway.\u201d\n\nThe writer compared the rules those leaders imposed to \u201cthe hedges in a steeplechase course\u201d that Italians used to show off their speed. Laws, he said, became a necessary evil if only because they provided the delight of evading them.\n\n\u201cHow could one circumvent laws if there were none?\u201d he wrote.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of thinking that Mr. Conte urged Italians to avoid.\n\n\u201cWe must safeguard our health,\u201d he said early Sunday, \u201cand that of those we love.\u201d\n\nIn some unlikely quarters, that message seemed to be breaking through.\n\nAntonio Ponti, 47, a D.J. in Milan\u2019s club scene, had planned a party in defiance of the crackdown on the city\u2019s night life. To skirt an ordinance against events in venues that don\u2019t allow people to keep a meter\u2019s distance from one another, he cleverly planned the party outdoors.\n\nBut as the toll of virus grew, and talk of tough restrictions resonated in Milan, he said he did not  want to be seen as a \u201cplague spreader.\u201d He followed the lead of other promoters and pulled the plug.\n\n\u201cIt is wiser,\u201d he said, \u201cif we help things get better.\u201d\n\nElisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome.\n\nJason Horowitz is the Rome bureau chief, covering Italy, the Vatican, Greece and other parts of Southern Europe.

So it's entirely possible, just almost certainly not desirable.\n\n&gt;Which they already have under the EU tariff schedule. \n\nNo, the EU tariff schedule covers a lot of different elements and is used to protect a slew of producers within the EU that the UK does not need to protect as it doesn't have those producers.. Moreover, the EU has traditionally been able to leverage the size of the UK market, but has been poor at either delivering on things like service access, and indeed slow to push the single market in services (which is why it is incomplete...).  Even things like the measures taken against the swiss on equivalence were leveraging UK markets to push a political agenda that the UK didn't particularly support..\n\n&gt;Not convinced at all that being able to fiddle with this will make for any of the damage whatsoever.\n\nIt'll mitigate some of the issue caused by the loss of membership, it isn't supposed to make up for it (there is no better economic relationship with the EU than membership of the EU..) but then this isn't a purely economic issue.\n\n&gt;No I think what I said was more accurate, prices were going down and then stopped going down mid 2016.\n\nIt's accurate if you ignore anything before 2016, which paints a pretty poor picture, and again, the summary from the linked document gives a much clearer view.\n\n&gt;Since then it's been more or less level (I'd say that looks a slight increase) thanks to the fact we haven't actually left yet .

Trying to take a snapshot to fit a narriative, or dismissing data isn't helpful in getting a clear picture of the impact. \n\n&gt;Probably thanks to the price of oil, I actually checked France and Germany and their food price inflation numbers are broadly similar.\n\nRight... There are lots of factors, but the outcome is still the same (and oil prices are crashing, so we could see a reduction in food prices, supermarkets are having to compete, that previously led to a crash in food prices, we are going to see a re-evaluation of supply chains, that could also lead to a drop in pricing..).  The likely outcome is a mild increase above inflation, but there are a massive number of factors.\n\n&gt;I can't seem to find the figures for real terms price changes for them though so it's hard to say if our prices have risen compared to theirs.\n\nIIRC ours have risen faster in real terms than Germany, slower in real terms than France.\n\n&gt;I'd be interested to see if their fall in prices and then the levelling off lines up with ours.\n\nIt doesn't because of a number of factors, including both the currency issues in the UK and political issues in France that have had an economic knock on and a couple of other elements IIRC.", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "created_utc": 1583860244, "id": "fk4gy8n", "author": "-ah", "link_id": "t3_ffxilc", "parent_id": "t1_fk4e0sg", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "What do we do with these conflicts?\n\nIt's very tempting to ignore them. Let the latest round of religious violence sort itself out, see what fanatical dictator emerges, and bribe him to get some of that tasty oil. We can pat ourselves on the back, because this time we didn't get involved in local politics that weren't our business, and we let those third world folks choose their own form of government and figure things out for themselves. Nobody has to feel guilty about drone strikes, or get called arrogant, because we held ourselves above the conflict (which is of course just as arrogant as wading in thinking you can fix everything, but at least you don't get *called* arrogant for disdaining to act).\n\nYet then come all the distressing reports during the violent times of genocides, chemical warfare, sex trafficking, slavery, mass killings, torture, etc. etc. etc., of all the old Sectarian hatreds flaring up until the region is engulfed in a war of everyone versus everyone. And you do kind of have to wonder how history is going to look back on the world that saw all this shit going down and shrugged, apathetic, pausing only to ask when the oil would resume flowing. And you have to ask yourself how long it'll be before someone looks outward for an enemy, one that could unite a lot of people under his or her war banner. And you have the floods of refugees who're going to want to escape to safer countries as long as there's a war on, whether or not the West is staying out of it - maybe that'll be good for the economy, maybe not. We'll have to see on that one. Point is, there're compelling reasons to want to promote stability in the region, which means intervening in some way.\n\nBut how do you stop a conflict like the endless Middle Eastern clusterfuck, in which each war is only the latest in a long series of battles? Well, an Iraqi friend once told me that his personal plan for Peace in the Mid East was to, and I quote, \"glass everything.\" True, he may have played too much WH40k for his own good, but it does kind of sum up what a Gordian knot the whole mess is, and how tempting it is to want a magic bullet (or Alexander the Great's sword) to solve all the problems - a simple, direct solution. Well, frankly, if you're expecting someone on Reddit to have even a *complicated* perfect answer, you're probably deluding yourself.\n\nFor instance: the idea of education as a miracle cure for radicalism. You begin to build a school; Islamists militants shoot at you. Boko Haram. The school is done; Islamists shoot at it. Kids come; Islamists shoot at them, pour acid on them, kidnap and rape them. Kids stop coming; Islamists continue to shoot at the school. Nobody is getting educated; Islamists continue to shoot things. Okay, well, maybe bring in some soldiers to go raid the Islamists, let the kids feel safe coming to learn. It works, they're dead, good job. But each one has five brothers and thirty cousins in and around the valley who now maybe want to shoot at you; several of them are the same age as your students, but you don't have to be 18 to wear a suicide vest. Now - I hear that this eventually began to work in Afghanistan, but I'm not sure that means it would work throughout the region as a whole, because it's not as simple as Westerners versus Islamists with peace-loving folks caught in the middle, not when you expand your scope to the whole Middle East.\n\nThere're too many fuckin' cooks, you see. To solve the Middle East as a whole, you'd have to deal with a whole shitton of different factions that have been trying to wipe one another out for centuries, and none of them really like you that much - they'll use you when you're convenient, and use their death squads when you aren't. And then of course you have Israel sitting there, hoping desperately that none of these bastards ever wield influence or buddy up long enough to take a swing at them - and maybe Israel isn't relying solely on *hope*, either. Also, it's political suicide to cross them because they spend a king's ransom on buying your representatives' loyalty. Also, they can't help but piss off everyone in the region. Meanwhile, Russia is nosing around for any old scraps of Soviet glory they might've left behind the last time they were in the Middle East (you know, before Rambo kicked them out with the help of the brave Mujaheddin). Meanwhile, your soldiers and aid workers are being killed and the public is getting sick of apparently shoveling good money after bad to no obvious effect. Meanwhile, there's another genocide happening in Africa. Meanwhile, North Korea finally worked up the balls to start a nuclear war. Meanwhile, China and Japan are sniping at each other and threatening an islandhopping campaign, and it looks like South Korea wants in, too, assuming it's not still fighting North Korea. Meanwhile, Eastern Europe caught on fire again. Meanwhile, Mexico just became a police state/cartel state/both. Meanwhile, Canada's maple syrup reserves went missing. Meanwhile, we are giving serious thought to establishing a colony on Mars in the near future, and what will the Russians think of *that?* Meanwhile, Australia opened up its first literal death camp for immigrants and doesn't see what all the fuss is about. Meanwhile, Shi'ite and Sunni refugees from the endless war in the Middle East are demanding housing in separate districts, because they've been in a peaceful country for a while and have remembered old grudges. Meanwhile, global warming is displacing millions of coastal- and island-dwelling peoples, killing crops, and ravaging small economies. Meanwhile, increased automation in the workforce has predictably done nothing but line the pockets of the ultrawealthy, and unemployment is skyrocketing. Meanwhile, Kanye West just became the POTUS. Meanwhile, everyone's too distracted by the latest round of culture wars to summon up the political will to deal with anything but whether or not gendering characters in assigned reading is transmisogynistic. Meanwhile, the fucking neo-Nazis are back, and they're mainstream now. Meanwhile, all of Los Angeles just fell into the Pacific Ocean. Meanwhile, scandals. Meanwhile, bird flu and swine flu, hurricanes and meltdowns. Malaria and polio resurgence. AI research. Red carpet gaffs. Firefly reboot. Steam goes offline. SOPA and PIPA and the TPPIPPIPITTPIPI. Ice-nine.\n\nThere will always be other things to worry about, and even America doesn't have the resources or will to do it all. America probably doesn't have the resources to even hold the whole Middle East for an entire generation's worth of education (and I say \"even\" like that'd be such a small feat, when it'd be anything but).\n\nUntil people decide to stop killing one another, the killing will continue. That is the only simple truth, and it is pretty much worthless because, if history is anything to go by, we quite like killing one another - or at least we always forget that we hate it. And what's more, everything in this post is a horrifying oversimplification.

What's going on is that people who aren't infected by the virus and rather just the normal flu-turned penumonia patients are blindly taken out by force along with all the \"virus-turned' penumonia patients. He's trying say that the recoverying rate is A LOT higher than the amount of people taken away (200+ a day), since they have only 200 capacity, it's cleaned out daily. that's just 1 hospital. He kept mentioning that once they are taken, they do NOT return. Meaning that they'er literally shoving everyone into the fukcking new \"hospital\" (it's not, it's a death camp. look at any pics posted of the inside of th hospital. ALL BEDS. NOT 1 bed has a fucking IV. THey'are all death beds bro) which mean. This guy also said. The usual rate hes seen of people recovering is about 50% ,but it don't matter bcus the army is grabbing 100% of all patients in the hospital. Regardless if they're infected or not, and regardless if they're in the process of actually recoverying, and regardless of ANY chance to recover, they all taken way. meaning, eventually, they all die. becuase the place they're taken to, literally has NOTHING. there's no media coverage on this because this is inside info from my relative's close friend's grandpa who is locked inside the new hospital they just built. and they literally have been eating CRACKERS 3 fuking meals a day. with little water. they're trying so hard to get someone who knows someone who has some kinda political power to bring some food to the grapna. and this is for everyone who's in the hospital. Also, by the way, inside that hospital, there is NO  doorknob on the inside. Only outside. Meaning you go in and die in there, you dont come out.

PLUS, they have started burning bodies on the outside, the area is HUGe apparently, and can be seen far away espeically at night becuase of the [fire.](https://fire.NO) Just straight burning bodies on the ground. So adding that into the equation, it's estimated 2000+ people dies  each day, not including the bodies that's laying around overtime because there's no more places to burn. the whole city is now covered in nasty thick fog, and the fog has a very distinct smell. That's from the burnt bodies. Not trying to scare yall, but the real estimate, taking everything I said in mind, caculated by inside people, and strictly covered up every where fucking where, i think even the US is covering it up  because we can't\"afford to create panic\". Here's the number..The realistic death toll s now 100,000+  (One hundred thousand plus) but remember, lots of people aren't actually infected...are dragged into that pile.

One third of hospitalized pts will end up in the ICU.\n\nThis would overrun our hospitals in terms of available beds, available ICU rooms and ventilators. Before this disease, hospitals basically run at full or 110% capacity (meaning, pts wait in the ER for the next available bed). On top of that there will be doctors and nurses on quarantine leading to understaffing (and clearly some staff will not come in to work due to fear, which we are already seeing).\n\nThis is what happened in Wuhan. Hospitals could not deal with the huge jump in severely sick pts (many of which would not die if they had adequate care). \n\nSo anything that can slow the spread of the disease (self quarantine, cancelled events, strict hygiene) will help our hospitals remain effective for those who are sick. \n\nPanickers focus on fear of death; deniers focus on 80% mild cases...neither of these attitudes are helpful. More people need to understand that we need to focus on trying not to overburden our hospitals and clinics i.e. staying home if they are mildly ill (basically,self-quarantine for the greater good). Don\u2019t go to your clinic or ER with mild symptoms. You\u2019ll clog up the system, when self quarantine and typical self care for a cold is all you need.\n\nEdits for grammar/typos\n\nEdit to add: What many don\u2019t know is that hospitals are already cancelling elective surgeries to make more ventilators available for the ICU. A lot of these people who need ventilators will not die. But if they don\u2019t get a ventilator, they will die.

positive cases] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/03/ontario-confirms-new-positive-cases-of-covid-19-4.html), bringing us to a total of 22 positive cases now. \n\nThe first two cases of today is a husband and wife who are both in their 60s. They recently traveled aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship out of San Francisco which traveled to Mexico. They were presented at Trillium Health Partners - Mississauga Hospital and are both now in self-isolation. \n\nThe third is a man in his 50s who recently returned from Iran and presented himself to North York General Hospital. He is now in self-isolation. The last case is a man in his 40s who came back from Las Vegas and was presented at Toronto Western Hospital. This makes him the first case we've had from the US (if you discount the couple from above since they were technically in Mexico, otherwise they're the first).\n\n___\n\nOld Table\n\nDate | Confirmed Cases | Presumptive Confirmed | Cases Recovered (Unoffical) | Cases Under Investigation | +/- From Previous Day\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n[February 1st-3rd] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ey9gbk/2_confirmed_recovered_1_confirmed_cases_and_29/)| 3 | 0  |2| 29 | +12\n[January 31st] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ews46v/1_confirmed_case_recovered_1_confirmed_case_17/)| 3 | 0 |2 | 17 | -10\n[January 30th] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ew9zze/2_confirmed_cases_and_27_cases_under/)| 2 | 0  |0| 27 | +4\n[January 29th] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/evpx1q/2_confirmed_cases_and_23_cases_under/)| 2 | 0 |0 | 23 | +12\n[January 28th] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ev7fie/1_confirmed_case_1_presumptive_confirmed_case_and/)| 1 | 1 |0 | 11 | -8\n[January 27th] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/eupoxr/2_presumptive_confirmed_cases_and_19_cases_under/)| 0 | 2 |0 | 19 | 0\n\n___", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583540129, "id": "fjp2bnj", "author": "Scyllarious", "link_id": "t3_femybg", "parent_id": "t3_femybg", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": true}, {"body": "&gt;... now that China actually really is/was going to surpass us I find it strange that they\u2019re dealing with this. Now with increased sinophobia and racism towards China it just seems whack. There have been a lot of arrests lately related to china.. red baiting McCarthy era type activity in the states.. The Huawei arrest... stuff that went down in Canada.. Chinese spies trying to get in Mar-a-lago..\n\nOh, there is a strong anti-Beijing force within the group that put up Trump as their face. It was one of Trump's election promise in 2016, wasn't it?\n\nPersonally I think it is well warranted considering what has happened since 1985-ish till 2016 in the US. **With the Israel's lead.**\n\nThis is coming from a former card-carrying Bernie bro.\n\nIt's just extremely regrettable that the current anti-Beijing movement seems to bring along despicable racism from all sides. \n\nI'll see you around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**As a parting thought:**\n\n**.1.** A full blown crash between the US and China is inevitable since China's trying to dominate at the two arenas: economic supremacy (the BRI) and arms race. Can't really blame China for trying those either. It's just how global hegemony works.\n\n**.2.** Many people, even here on this sub, misinterpreted the Huawei issue as simply a 5G thing (well ... because that's all the MSM are saying), but it's rather about military weapon technologies.\n\n5G + next-gen optical sensors &amp; software + quantum computing = next-gen air defense systems &amp; missile systems.\n\nWhat is one of the biggest reasons why US military strength is still superior? Navy. More precisely because of its supercarriers. How China is trying to bypass it? Next-gen air defense systems &amp; missile systems, a.k.a carrier killer.\n\nWho stole the US missile systems and sold them to China? Israel. If you research on this, you'd find it complicated and at the same time upsetting (if you were a US citizen that is. \\^\\^').\n\n**.3.** For the recent arrest you mentioned: Since 1980s till 2015-ish the globalist faction in the US &amp; Israel, including the US neocons, started to move or sell off the US' assets &amp; technologies to China. It's a well known + well documented affair. There are many theories on why, but I digress.\n\nLately, the non-globalist faction in the US has finally been trying to *overturn the tide.* For the US, it's like people say: better late than never.\n\n**.4.** For the record, I like the theory I mentioned earlier best because it has the least of logical deficiencies:\n\n\\-- **Xi Jinping &amp; his Princelings** could be the one but they got many things to lose because of the event. Although Xi Jinping was able to set himself up to remain *president for life* (on March 2018, right?), he is still on the process of consolidating political power under Princelings, meaning if he let this event to be blown up to the next level, it will greatly endanger his authority within State Council.\n\nHence, has the blaming game from/within China already initiated putting a renowned SARS expert Zhong Nanshan (\u949f\u5357\u5c71) up at the forefront. People I know whose day job is analyst, they're expecting that the opinion will come out from China soon which would be \"This COVID-19 has originated from a US patient last year. Not from China.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, who would be the biggest beneficiary IF Xi's political downfall happens? Not the current US admin. Because China's foreign policies will stay same even IF it happens, since Shanghai clique will surely take over.\n\n\\-- **The current US admin** could be the one but this is an election year. One of their so called accomplishment for the first term that they can boast of is the Dow Jones.\n\nI know there is a theory that concerns a financial reset, but IF the reset indeed happens this year, Trump's chances of winning at the reelection would be enormously undermined.\n\n\\-- Besides, Trump *NEEDS* China to *do well enough* during 2020 for China to keep the promise of the phase one U.S.-China trade deal: China's increased purchase of American products &amp; services by at least $200 billion over the next two years, which is almost twice the size of what China purchased before the trade war began.\n\nAnd as you can guess, it's another *accomplishment* by the current US admin that Trump can boast of on the upcoming campaign trails.\n\nBut if what goes on in China continues, there is a high chance China would/could not meet the phase one deal.\n\n**Jan. 31, 2020 -- Coronavirus could hurt China\u2019s phase one implementation**\n\n[https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2020/01/31/coronavirus-could-hurt-chinas-phase-one-implementation-784908](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2020/01/31/coronavirus-could-hurt-chinas-phase-one-implementation-784908)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoly.

U.S. equities are coming off their first back-to-back 9% swings since the Great Depression as investors try to price the impact of a global pandemic.\n\n\nInvestors remain rattled by the virus and its potential to derail global growth. Goldman Sachs cut its growth forecasts for the first half, Nike closed stores in North America and Apple shut all stores outside of China.\n\n\u201cThey had no choice, but it won\u2019t be enough in the grand scheme of things,\u201d said Jeff Mills, chief investment officer of Bryn Mawr Trust. \u201cWe need large fiscal programs, which, based on the recent communication from the treasury secretary, it seems clear we will be getting.\u201d\n\nThe extreme volatility of recent sessions makes it difficult to consider futures a perfect litmus for grading the Fed\u2019s response. Contracts bounced between exchange-enforced volatility limits throughout last week, while Friday saw the biggest U.S. stock market rally in 12 years. That surge may have been attributable in part to expectations the Fed would act over the weekend.\n\nSimilar turbulence has gripped markets around the world amid an outbreak that threatens to plunge the global economy into recession. Gauges of stock swings hit levels last seen in the financial crisis and the S&amp;P 500 notched back-to-back 9% moves for the first time since the 1930s on Thursday and Friday.\n\n\u201cWhat a roller-coaster ride this is turning out to be,\u201d Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, wrote in a note. \u201cI never thought I would see such volatility, intra-day moves and general dislocations again in highly developed markets.\u201d\n\nS&amp;P 500 rose or fell at least 4% five days in a row, a stretch not seen since 1929\nThe index jumped more than 5 percentage points in the final 30 minutes Friday to cap a 9% rally that was the biggest in over a decade, spurred by Trump declaring a national emergency and outlining measures to support the economy.\n\n\nThe virus has spread to more than 3,000 Americans and grinding activity in Europe to a virtual standstill.\n\n\u201c\u2018There will be an economic impact,\u201d said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors. \u201cWe won\u2019t know what that is until we see the data.\u201d\n\nAn uneven response from politicians has rattled investors trying to figure out how to value companies whose earnings forecasts have become useless. Nike Inc. closed all its stores in North America and Western Europe Sunday, while Apple Inc. shuttered its outlets everywhere but China until March 27.\n\nU.S. economic growth is forecast to nearly halt in the second quarter and recession odds have jumped, Bloomberg\u2019s March 6-12 survey of economists shows.\n\n\u201cThe inherent uncertainties stemming from the spreading of the virus were multiplied many times over by some dreadful policy communication, but also tempered by a series of outstanding policy measures, including actions by central banks and fiscal authorities,\u201d UniCredit\u2019s Nielsen said.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 average a move of 7.2% last week in the most volatile period since 2008. Stocks dropped 9.5% Thursday and rose 9.3% Friday, in the first such reversal since the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cWe tend, in the midst of bear markets, in these crises, to see big, big swings like this, both on the downside and the upside,\u201d said Jennifer Ellison, principal at San Francisco-based wealth-advisory firm BOS. \u201cWe get this self-fulfilling prophecy.

It is even  beyond novel &amp; video game virus  version one. It is the absolutely  perfect one virus.\n\n**I will tell you some basic features of the nCOV:**\n\n\u2013 It can hide and stay in many popular daily objects like technology devices, doors, motors, cars, cloths, etc.\n\n\u2013 It can stay in almost all conditions like humans including cold and hot.\n\n\u2013 It can easily spread through air.\n\n\u2013 It has all the features of a combination SARS, Ebola, HIV and even more than that.\n\n\u2013 It can detect bad &amp; good people &amp; has it own spirit like a seen animal.\n\n\u2013 It can develop and has it own evolution daily non-stop to adapt new environment.\n\n\u2013 No any vaccine drug can work for this type of virus.\n\nEtc.\n\n**You may ask so are we all going to receive that deadly virus?**\n\nMy answer is that yes, all of you are going to receive that type in your life.\n\nMany  \u201cweaker\u201d Virus exist in your daily  life environment already, it just  that they are not \u201cstrong\u201d enough for  human need to be aware. But now  it is just a more \u201cstronger\u201d one.\n\n**How to counter &amp; overcome that nCOV virus?**\n\nI  am not telling you now because I want to  change the world system  completely and give people more choice. And my  blog website not yet  famous. I do not want any secret societies, beings,  government stealing  &amp; take credit for my own invention &amp;  creation.\n\nMaybe  many of the world leaders are in  same bed, same secret societies and  work against &amp; want enslave the  rest.

In France, a front-page headline in a regional newspaper warned of a \u201cYellow Alert.\u201d And in a suburb of Toronto, parents demanded that a school district keep children of a family that had recently returned from China out of classes for 17 days.\n\nThe rapid spread of the coronavirus that has sickened about 9,800 people \u2014 the overwhelming majority in China, with all of the 213 deaths there \u2014 has unleashed a wave of panic and, in some cases, outright anti-Chinese sentiment across the globe.\n\nWhile officials scramble to contain the crisis \u2014 the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency and the State Department issued a \u201cdo not travel\u201d to China advisory \u2014 fears over the dangerous outbreak have fueled xenophobia. And the wave of spreading panic has, at times, far outstripped practical concerns.\n\nAt a time when China\u2019s rise as a global economic and military power has unsettled its neighbors in Asia as well as its rivals in the West, the coronavirus is feeding into latent bigotry against the people of mainland China.\n\n\u201cSome of the xenophobia is likely undergirded by broader political and economic tensions and anxieties related to China, which are interacting with more recent fears of contagion,\u201d said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.\n\nSome of the response to the outbreak can be seen as a rational calculation based on the risk of infection: Airlines are canceling flights to Wuhan, the center of the epidemic, and other Chinese cities, and conference organizers are asking Chinese delegations not to attend. \n\nLate Thursday, Italy\u2019s prime minister said that his country had blocked all flights to and from China. And countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia and Vietnam have temporarily stopped issuing certain classes of visas to travelers from Hubei Province, where Wuhan is situated, or China altogether.\n\n\u201cI think it is time to put a temporary \u2018do not enter\u2019 sign on our doorstep for visitors from China,\u201d said Ralph Recto, a lawmaker in the Philippines.\n\nBangkok residents are avoiding malls that are particularly popular with Chinese tourists.

But some protective measures have effectively amounted to racial or ethnic profiling.\n\nAt Bread Box, a banh mi restaurant in central Hoi An, a popular tourist outpost in Vietnam, the owners posted a makeshift sign outside their storefront this month reading, \u201cWe can\u2019t service for Chinese, SORRY!\u201d Up the coast, the Danang Riverside Hotel announced on Saturday that it would not accept any Chinese guests because of the virus.\n\nKwong Wing Catering, a small restaurant chain in Hong Kong, announced in a Facebook post on Wednesday that it would serve only patrons speaking English or Cantonese, the city\u2019s native language \u2014 a tongue distinct from the Mandarin spoken on the mainland.

In Australia, The Herald Sun, a Murdoch-owned newspaper, published the words \u201cChina Virus Panda-monium\u201d over an image of a red mask. More than 46,000 people from the resident Chinese community in Australia signed a petition that called the headline \u201cunacceptable race discrimination.\u201d\n\nLe Courrier Picard, a regional newspaper in northern France, caused outrage with its \u201cYellow Alert\u201d headline this month. The newspaper later apologized.\n\nOn Twitter in Japan, where there has long been unease about the conduct of Chinese tourists, commenters have labeled them \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201cinsensitive\u201d and have called them \u201cbioterrorists.\u201d", "subreddit": "China", "created_utc": 1580528164, "id": "fg5i7ni", "author": "vilekangaree", "link_id": "t3_ex06cq", "parent_id": "t3_ex06cq", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "It wouldn\u2019t sustain it and would mutate, it would also be unwise to publish the exact vulnerability of the virus coming from the wuhan lab if the \u201cengineered\u201d it.

When we make facile comparisons between the flu and coronaviruses, they may prove valid, but for now it\u2019s still wise to remember that annual flu cases could be fewer than what is guessed at through modeling each year, and corona infections may be higher than the current known numbers of confirmed positives. The former reality might mean that the flu is at times a little more lethal than we think and the corona virus a little less deadly. That is not to suggest that most strains of flu are as lethal as the coronavirus, only that for the vast majority of Americans the current U.S. COVID-19 case-to-fatality ratio of 2 percent may eventually prove less, and influenza\u2019s commonly cited 0.01 lethality rate may prove higher. In any case, 98\u201399 percent of Americans may well recover from the coronavirus \u2014 a rate that is not typical of most of history\u2019s plagues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe realities are paradoxical: If the coronavirus infects as many Americans as an average flu strain, then ten times more Americans could die \u2014 mostly over the age of 65 \u2014 even as the vast majority of all Americans will not.

Americans will not again wish to outsource the vast majority of their chemotherapy-drug, antibiotic, and heart-medicine production to a government that cannot be trusted and that sees such globalized output as a weapon to be used in extremis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough we cannot see it now, spin-off effects from the panic and frenzy will eventually fuel more economic recovery.

When compared to the official number of infected China has claimed + rest of the world, about 31,000,, that'd make the fatality rate something like 30%-50%. Of course that seems far too high, which tells us China is definitely lying about the number of infected. I'd be willing to bet the actual fatality rate is about 10%. Same as SARS.\n\nBecause that's what this thing is: SARS. Something I haven't seen mentioned at all.\n\nIn reality the 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus is a sibling of SARS (which is itself a coronavirus). They're extremely close. Not just extremely: they're basically fucking identical. The only real difference is in a couple proteins which changes how it binds to cells (which changes the way it spreads between humans). But the way they enter the cell, and everything after that (replicating in the cell, etc), is 100% identical.\n\nSARS itself is incredibly lethal and dangerous, with a fatality rate of 10%, which rises to 50% in the elderly. \n\nHowever, like most fatal infections, SARS has limited spread, and thus never became a big issue. Diseases like that usually kill hundreds and then burn themselves out. They aren't able to start massive pandemics like a flu is able to.\n\nHowever, this seems different. This seems like it's spreading incredibly fast.\n\nThat, combined with the overwhelming evidence that this is man made, makes everything fall into place.\n\nBasically what happened was a high level biowarfare lab had the idea of taking extremely fatal, yet not readily spreadable/infectious diseases, and altering them in order to make them able to spread fast, like a flu.\n\nThat's why this Wuhan coronavirus has some weird HIV inserts and some other seemingly random changes. Yet fundamentally it's identical to SARS and they're mostly the same virus.\n\nThis could be very bad. If it even has a 5% mortality rate then we're fucked. It will kill a lot of people. This could potentially be super-SARS, SARS with the same lethality but 10x the rate of infection.\n\nLike I said, the only real difference between SARS and this coronavirus is how they initially bind to the cell. The 2019 coronavirus has a new protein which seems to allow it to bind to alveolar cells, meaning the lungs. This means the lungs have now become a prime entrance for this virus + coughing can spread it effectively now too.\n\nLike I said, nearly the same virus except for a few key (and intelligently designed) differences.", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "created_utc": 1581140062, "id": "fgv84xf", "author": "BigYellowLemon", "link_id": "t3_f0ewha", "parent_id": "t3_f0ewha", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "(Copied from my answer to another post) I do not know when this stuupidity will end.

I am disappointed not because of this single incidence, but because human beings are stuupid and irrational biologically and are easily steered by fake-news-media.\n\nYes I found the report,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/us/cindy-yang-trump-donations.html ; there is a picture of such a conference flyer in the same report,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/15/us/00massage-berkshire/00massage-berkshire-master1050.jpg . Quote from the report, \"Ms. Yang, who attended the inauguration, started a company \u2014 GY US Investments \u2014 that promised Chinese businesspeople access to American politicians, including Mr. Trump. Clients were offered entry to events, including White House visits, \u201cVIP activities at Mar-a-Lago\u201d and Warren Buffett\u2019s annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.\n\nSun Ye, an actress in Beijing, was among those who appeared in photographs on Ms. Yang\u2019s website. Ms. Sun said she wanted to travel to the United States to burnish her image in China and abroad. She said she took a deluxe tour last year that included visits to Harvard, the Nasdaq marketplace and the White House. For part of the trip, she said, she stayed with Ms. Yang.\n\nThe highlight, she said, was to be in a photo with the president at a New Year\u2019s party at Mar-a-Lago, one of the events promoted on Ms. Yang\u2019s website.\n\nMr. Trump, however, skipped the party and stayed in Washington because of a government shutdown. Ms. Sun settled for a photo with his son Donald Jr.\n\n\u201cI wanted to see the president of the United States, and although I didn\u2019t meet him, I met his family,\u201d Ms. Sun said in an interview in Beijing. \u201cIt made me feel like I achieved my dream.\u201d\"", "subreddit": "politics", "created_utc": 1554900279, "id": "ekjk860", "author": "PotomacNeuron", "link_id": "t3_bb88c4", "parent_id": "t3_bb88c4", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": true, "love": true, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Center for Disease Control's 2017 seasonal flu world wide death estimates:\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1213-flu-death-estimate.html\n\nExcerpt:\n\nAccording to new estimates published today, between 291,000 and 646,000 people worldwide die from seasonal influenza-related respiratory illnesses each year, higher than a previous estimate of 250,000 to 500,000 and based on a robust, multinational survey.\n\nThe new estimate, from a collaborative study by CDC and global health partners, appears today in The Lancet. The estimate excludes deaths during pandemics.\n\n\u201cThese findings remind us of the seriousness of flu and that flu prevention should really be a global priority,\u201d says Joe Bresee, M.D., associate director for global health in CDC\u2019s Influenza Division and a study co-author.\n\nThe new estimates use more recent data, taken from a larger and more diverse group of countries than previous estimates. Forty-seven countries contributed to this effort. Researchers calculated annual seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths for 33 of those countries (57 percent of the world\u2019s population) that had death records and seasonal influenza surveillance information for a minimum of four years between 1999 and 2015. Statistical modeling with those results was used to generate an estimate of the number of flu-associated respiratory deaths for 185 countries across the world. Data from the other 14 countries were used to validate the estimates of seasonal influenza-associated respiratory death from the statistical models.\n\nPoorest nations, older adults hit hardest by flu\n\nResearchers calculated region-specific estimates and age-specific mortality estimates for people younger than 65 years, people 65-74 years, and people 75 years and older. The greatest flu mortality burden was seen in the world\u2019s poorest regions and among older adults. People age 75 years and older and people living in sub-Saharan African countries experienced the highest rates of flu-associated respiratory deaths. Eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asian countries had slightly lower but still high rates of flu-associated respiratory deaths.\n\n-End Excerpt-\n\nFlu Kills 646,000 People Worldwide Each Year: Lancet Study\n\nhttps://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=208914\n\nhttps://afludiary.blogspot.com/2017/12/the-lancet-estimates-of-global-seasonal.html\n\nNow compare the number of current Coronavirus flu pandemic deaths (7,100) https://coronamap.org to the 2017 Lancet study linked above showing regular yearly flu related deaths worldwide (646,000) - Regular yearly flu kills 100 times more people. Now try to explain the level of reaction to the current crisis which appears manufactured. The reaction is not reasonably explainable. The reaction and media manifestation of fear and over-reactionary behavior is in itself a massive anomaly in relation to regular yearly flu deaths. Thus, one should ask \"what are the corrupt Elite and their media minions and political puppets attempting to gain from all this orchestrated chaos and disruption of human lives?\" Is this just another extension of the Order From Chaos agenda, more distraction from their crimes, more giveaways to their banking partners?", "subreddit": "worldnews", "created_utc": 1584464846, "id": "fkra7pw", "author": "ClarityofSignal", "link_id": "t3_fk5i1m", "parent_id": "t1_fkqrrmq", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Can you imagine how dumb that review would sound?\n\n\u201cPeru: 1 \u2b50\ufe0f\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was the worst vacation of my life!
