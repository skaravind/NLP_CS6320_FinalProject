That's a career-ending condemnation.\n\nSo, a physician unjustly performing euthanasia shouldn't be convicted of manslaughter or murder? You're going to have a hard time selling me that.\n\n&gt; People who really want to live will exhaust every method available, don't worry.\n\nWill every method available be actually available to them? Is it now? Even with public healthcare, not every procedure is available to everyone eligible, so yes, we have much to improve upon.\n\nImagine a following scenario:\n\nA patient is in need of a critical procedure which would improve their quality of life, but it is not performed in their country, so to get the procedure done, they would have to travel to another country and get it done there. They would of course have to pay for the procedure and travel expenses, because their home insurance doesn't cover said procedure. The patient cannot afford such an expense. Is it therefore ethical to performe euthanasia on this patient? If euthanasia is not performed, the patient has the choice to refuse all other treatment or receive palliative care. Which do you choose?\n\nIt leaves a bad taste in the mouth, but such cases do exist.\n\n&gt; their choice of treatment or no treatment. Dragging things out isn't always better than dying.\n\nNo treatment option doesn't always mean dragging thing out. it means making a person comfortable.\n\n&gt; That's a matter of the legislation, of no importance on considering whether it should exist at all or not.\n\nResearch funding goes where there's money to be made. Look at the amount of articles published on COVID-19 right now. Euthanasia will divert funding away from other research looking at improving palliative care and improving quality of life before passing.\n\n&gt; I don't see why it wouldn't, and that's indeed what happens in practice. Some doctors would rather not be involved, and leave it to others. Similarly some doctors don't perform abortion. For what reason isn't important, some specialization isn't harmful as long as access to all options is preserved.\n\nI'm not talking about that. I'm talking about Euthanasia creating a new category of patients, which will have to be faithfully represented in research. Statistics are a great way to hide things and this new category will make a new challenge to critically evaluate research.\n\n&gt; It's not a choice between different flavors, it's a choice to not eat at all. It's more a life choice than a type of treatment.\n\nThat's exactly what I said. There are clear indications when to administer food and when not to (any and all kinds of food).\n\n&gt; They do have to explain when the patient asks. But there are, for example, no physicians on the street informing random passers-by of their medical options. They will respond with options when a patient comes to them with a problem or desire, they won't volunteer everything the patient could possible do, which is quite a lot if you include things like elective surgery like plastic surgery and preventive operations. In general, the patient comes to the doctor with a medical problem to have that problem solved. Euthanasia typically only comes into play when all options are exhausted, or when the patient is no longer willing to undergo increasingly burdensome treatments with less and less chance of success. When a patient comes out of the blue asking for euthanasia, the norma reflex is to ask to motivate that, and if the patient says \"I want euthanasia because I have an unbearable itch\" then the doctor will say \"but have you tried scratching it?\" and so on. A typical legal euthanasia process requires formal documentation of these steps.\n\nI'm going to attribute this to your unfamiliarity with the medical profession and not to you deliberately misrepresenting what I have written.\n\n&gt; \"Lessen suffering\" is not good enough if you can outright end it. The value of life is not infinite.\n\nFirstly, with this end, you don't just end suffering, you end everything. And secondly, I already said that euthanasia can be justified in some cases. We're going in circles.\n\n&gt; It's up to the patient to decide whether they want to bear the burdens of the process.\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt; No, he's simply executor of the will of the patient.\n\nHe is most definitely not. The patient is the executor of his own will. He is a partner in healthcare, offering services. Nobody expects that a physician will do something a patient wants just because they want it. That may be in the US, where a patient can almost always find a physician who will do their bidding but it is most certainly not the case here.\n\n&gt; There also is absolutely no doubt about what the result of euthanasia will be.\n\nThe physician would role change with such an option, not because the end result of euthanasia wouldn't be known but because it is. Does a policeman have the right to you deadly force or does he have to prove the court he had to use it afterwards? Only a soldier on the battlefield can kill and even then it is possible he may be reprimanded, if the kill wasn't justified. Do you want to give physicians a right to kill with basically no oversight? I am in no way trying to compare the deaths on the battlefield with those of patients, but the right to cause a death of a person is at issue and that is not to be taken lightly.\n\n&gt; It's quite unempathic to refuse a suffering patient their only way out.\n\nAnd this is not even addressing the quote.", "subreddit": "europe", "created_utc": 1582658582, "id": "fir6xh2", "author": "jelencek", "link_id": "t3_f6xnu3", "parent_id": "t1_fiqyd3a", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "**Anthony S.

It happened while at a destination wedding in Cancun. For anyone who has ever been to the touristy area of Cancun, where all of the hotels and resorts are located, it is a very peaceful, relatively safe place; aside from the occasional drunk frat boy who might start a fist fight. We had a very large group for a destination wedding (about 80 people), and out of those 80, about 50 of us were middle aged (20-40). The resort we stayed at was all-inclusive, so anything we wanted was \"free\". Free booze, food, activities; it was awesome. \n\n    Here is where the sketchiness begins. It is well known among my family that I have a lot of experience with drugs and know how to buy them, while avoiding getting burned, so I was the guy who had to take care getting coke for all of the other guys who were either too afraid to try to cold cop, or couldn't speak a lick of Spanish (I am not fluent but am definitely able to communicate with someone using only Spanish). Once I was requested to find some blow, I got the money and walked right up to the bellhop of our resort and I straight up asked him where to get nieve. He hailed a cab from a different que than the normal one, I get in, we start driving down the highway, the driver shows me his product, I tell him I'm not buying it without a taste, so he pours out a huge bump on his hand and I snort it off there while he is driving 70mph down the road. The shit was good, I bought a couple hundred worth, and he took me back to the resort. That was easy, I thought, and when I got back to my hotel, I tipped the bellhop for hooking it up. I did this the following two days and everything went smoothly. Then on the day before the wedding, all of the men went to \"downtown\" Cancun for his second bachelor party. Initiate the real sketchy story now.\n\n    In Cancun, there is a free bus that runs up and down the main strip where all of the resorts are located and one of the last stops, before the bus turns around to continue the loop. is in downtown Cancun. I have spent my fair share of time in some of hoods in the US, but when we got off that bus, my extremely drunk mind was still wise enough to realize this was not a tourist area, this was a third world fucking ghetto. Whatever, there were about 15 of us (travel in numbers, right) in the party, plus there were a few streetlights so I figured we were safe enough. We commence to walking down this street that not a single person knows where it leads (but we were drink so we were dafe in our minds...). After walking for a bit, I noticed a kid (14ish) posted up against a streetlight. From my experience, I was about 99% sure he was a lookout for someone, so I approached him and drunkenly asked \"where the girls, titties, snow, man\" in shit hammered Spanglish. He told us to follow him and we obliged. After walking for several blocks,, we got to this big, black, two-story building with maybe one window and a giant metal staircase. He assured me this was where the girls were, I gave him $5 and he was on his way. \n\n    In front of the staircase was the most absolute unit of a Mexican. It was obvious                                                that he was the bouncer so I asked him how much to get in, He told me $15/head and after quite a bit of haggling, he agreed to take me up to the club to look around before we dropped $225 to be allowed access to a place that we couldn't even see. The place had all of the symptoms of a strip club: poles, proper seating, bar, VIP, etc, but it was missing one thing; customers. We haggled some more over the fact that the place was dead and none of the girls were even dancing (they all flocked to me, grabbing my junk and, calling me Papi, but that's it)  I got him to let us in for free, using the fact that 15 people are about to go drop a ton of money at this place. Once we got in there, I knew what I had done: I brought us to a brother (keep in mind that about 75% ig the dudes I was with were either married or engage, but that didn't stop most of them. Oh, well, what happens in Cancun stays in Cancun, right?\n\n    Enough filler material. This is where I got myself in what I consider one of the top 3 sketchiest moments of my entire life. Remember the boy from the lamppost earlier&gt; He was in the club, posted up on a pillar this time. I was furious and proceeded to walk over to him and I took off my belt and started spanking him because he was too young to see boobs. Everyone applauded. /s What actually happened was I walked up to him and said\"what about that snow\"? He said \"come with me\" so I grabbed a Corona and walked down the stairs to the exit. He told me  to follow him because he isn't holding (I knew he was a lookout boy). Now I am walking down an unlit alleyway with some low-ranking cartel boy on my way to buy drugs (I didn't bring the cash with me because if they were going to rob me, they were only going to get the $20 in my wallet). After ten minutes or so, we come up to a big dude who asks me what I want. I told him $300 and he told me that he doesn't have that much on him, so we have to walk more to get to his supervisor. Another 10 minutes of walking and I see this guy wearing a nice-ass suit with a Blu-tooth earpiece in (pretty fancy technology for the time) so I immediately knew this guy was higher up the chain. I tell him what I want and he asks for the cash but I tell him it's at the club with my friends,\n\n    We walk back to the club together and when Suit Guy gets near the bouncer, he immediate gets out of his was with no words esaid. That was the other indication that Suit Guy has some pull. We get up to the club, I gather the cash and meet Suit Guy in the bathroom to get the blow, everything goes smoothly, Suit Guy leaves and I throw the kid $20 for hooking it up. We spent the next several hours doing blow in the bathroom and hanging out with the girls. I dd not get a lap dance there because that meant you're fucking, and I was not about to fuck a Mexican prostitute in an extremely seedy area. \n\n    The following day, when I woke and let out an audible \"WWWHHHHEEEEEWWWWW\" because I was kind of sobering up and it made me realize how horribly wrong the previous night could have went.It was either that or hr could tell Iwas not worth holding for ransom lol.\n\nFunny Story:My twenty something year old cousin went in the back for a private dance and came rushing out a few ninutes later. I asked him \"wtf\" dude\" then he proceeded to tell me that while she was dancing on him, she unzipped his pants, spit on her hands and started jerking him off. He was like \"Am I gonna catch something?\" I told him hr was probably fine but he should get tested when he gets back, even if it just for her safety,\n\nTLDR: Went to Mexico, tried to find a strip club, found a whorehouse instead, and I put myself in a situation where I could have been kidnapped", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "created_utc": 1528435844, "id": "e0b9fgd", "author": "sDotAgain", "link_id": "t3_8pfpxg", "parent_id": "t3_8pfpxg", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Corona Virus Cases..\n\nNew York\nwk 1 - 2\nwk 2 - 105\nwk 3 - 613\n\nFrance \nwk 1 - 12\nwk 2 - 191\nwk 3 - 653\nwk 4 - 4499\n\nIran\nwk 1 - 2\nwk 2 - 43\nwk 3 - 245\nwk 4 - 4747\nwk 5 - 12729\n\nItaly\nwk 1 - 3\nwk 2 - 152\nwk 3 - 1036\nwk 4 - 6362\nwk 5 - 21157\n\nSpain\nwk 1 - 8\nwk 3 - 674\nwk 4 - 6043\n\n\nIndia \n\nWeek 1 - 3\nWeek 2 - 24\nWeek 3 - 105\n\nNext two weeks are crucial for India.\nIf we take adequate precaution and break the chain then we can tide the Corona virus Outbreak else we have a big problem in hand especially for the elderly population\nSo far so good.

In Wuhuan, there are 11 million people, on Dec. 31,2019 China said they were treating a dozen cases, before lunar chinese new years ( before the city closed down on Jan23), 5 millions wuhuan citizens left for new year (going hometown or oversea to visit family). to now, there are only **78,832**  cases in all China?  \n\n4)They are doing whatever they can to contain it yes.

As providers of information, you play a vital role in the response to COVID-19. \n\n&gt;The fight against rumours and misinformation is a vital part of the battle against this virus. We rely on you to make sure people have accurate information about the threat they face, and how to protect themselves and others. \n\n&gt;Now to the numbers. \n\n&gt;There is now a total of 95,265 reported cases of COVID-19 globally, and 3281 deaths. \n\n&gt;In the past 24 hours, China reported 143 cases. Most cases continue to be reported from Hubei province, and 8 provinces have not reported any cases in the last 14 days. \n\n&gt;Outside China, 2055 cases were reported in 33 countries. Around 80% of those cases continue to come from just three countries. \n\n&gt;We see encouraging signs from the Republic of Korea. The number of newly-reported cases appears to be declining, and the cases that are being reported are being identified primarily from known clusters. \n\n&gt;Although a few countries are reporting large numbers of cases, 115 countries have not reported any cases. \n\n&gt;21 countries have reported only one case. \n\n&gt;And 5 countries that had reported cases have not reported new cases in the past 14 days. \n\n&gt;The experience of these countries and of China continues to demonstrate that this is not a one-way street. \n\n&gt;This epidemic can be pushed back, but only with a collective, coordinated and comprehensive approach that engages the entire machinery of government. \n\n&gt;We are calling on every country to act with speed, scale and clear-minded determination. \n\n&gt;Although we continue to see the majority of cases in a handful of countries, we are deeply concerned about the increasing number of countries reporting cases, especially those with weaker health systems. \n\n&gt;However, this epidemic is a threat for every country, rich and poor. As we have said before, even high-income countries should expect surprises. The solution is aggressive preparedness. \n\n&gt;We\u2019re concerned that some countries have either not taken this seriously enough, or have decided there\u2019s nothing they can do. \n\n&gt;We are concerned that in some countries the level of political commitment and the actions that demonstrate that commitment do not match the level of the threat we all face. \n\n&gt;This is not a drill. \n\n&gt;This is not the time to give up. \n\n&gt;This is not a time for excuses. \n\n&gt;This is a time for pulling out all the stops.\n\n&gt;Countries have been planning for scenarios like this for decades. Now is the time to act on those plans.\n\n&gt;These are plans that start with leadership from the top, coordinating every part of government, not just the health ministry \u2013 security, diplomacy, finance, commerce, transport, trade, information and more \u2013 the whole government should be involved.\n\n&gt;Activate your emergency plans through that whole-government approach.\n\n&gt;Educate your public, so that people know what the symptoms are and know how to protect themselves and others.\n\n&gt;Increase your testing capacity.\n\n&gt;Get your hospitals ready.\n\n&gt;Ensure essential supplies are available.\n\n&gt;Train your health workers to identify cases, provide careful and compassionate treatment, and protect themselves from infection.\n\n&gt;If countries act aggressively to find, isolate and treat cases, and to trace every contact, they can change the trajectory of this epidemic.\n\n&gt;If we take the approach that there\u2019s nothing we can do, that will quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s in our hands.\n\n&gt;WHO has published step-by-step guidelines for countries to develop their national action plans according to eight key areas, which are supported by detailed technical guidance.\n\n&gt;We call on all countries to accelerate those plans, and we stand ready to work with them to do that.\n\n&gt;More funding is being made available to support countries that need it, and that have plans in place.\n\n&gt;As you know, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have both made funds available to stabilize health systems and mitigate the economic consequences of the epidemic, with a special focus on enabling access to critical supplies and equipment.\n\n&gt;I had also a very fruitful discussion with the President of the African Development Bank.\n\n&gt;This is funding that is available now to countries who need it, in line with WHO\u2019s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan.\n\n&gt;These funds are essential for supporting the response now, but also for long-term preparedness.\n\n&gt;Although COVID-19 presents an acute threat now, it is absolutely essential that countries do not lose this opportunity to strengthen their preparedness systems.\n\n&gt;We know people are afraid, and that\u2019s normal and appropriate.\n\n&gt;That fear can be managed and moderated with accurate information. Today WHO has launched a new social media campaign called Be Ready for COVID-19, which urges people to be safe, smart and informed.\n\n&gt;If you feel overwhelmed by fear, reach out to those around you. Find out what your community\u2019s emergency response plans are, how you fit in and how you can help. \n\n&gt;There\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know, but every day we\u2019re learning more, and we\u2019re working around the clock to fill in the gaps in our knowledge. \n\n&gt;Ultimately, how deadly this virus will be depends not only on the virus itself, but on how we respond to it. \n\n&gt;This is a serious disease. It is not deadly to most people, but it can kill. \n\n&gt;We\u2019re all responsible for reducing our own risk of infection, and if we\u2019re infected, for reducing our risk of infecting others.\n\n&gt;There\u2019s something all of us can do to protect vulnerable people in our communities.\n\n&gt;That\u2019s why we keep talking about solidarity. \n\n&gt;This is not just a threat for individual people, or individual countries.\n\n&gt;We\u2019re all in this together, and we can only save lives together.\n\n&gt;I thank you\n\nhttps://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---5-march-2020", "subreddit": "worldnews", "created_utc": 1583489044, "id": "fjmxkj1", "author": "apple_kicks", "link_id": "t3_fcolqr", "parent_id": "t3_fcolqr", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": true, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "I was visiting New Orleans on my way from TX to VA.

But world leaders and media elites definitely have a responsibility to think through what they say--and I do not really give them the benefit of the doubt if *they* claim ignorance.

La empresa m\u00e1s valiosa del mundo no ser\u00e1 estadounidense ni china, sino saud\u00ed. Se llama Aramco, es una petrolera y pertenece a un solo tipo, el rey de Arabia Saudita, Salm\u00e1n bin Abdulaziz.\n&gt; \n&gt; El reino saud\u00ed acaba de confirmar que, esta vez s\u00ed, Aramco saldr\u00e1 a la bolsa. El s\u00e1bado se dar\u00e1n a conocer las condiciones y desde diciembre empezar\u00e1 a vender apenas un pu\u00f1ado de acciones en la bolsa de Ryad. Se calcula que con s\u00f3lo vender 1% de sus acciones va a recaudar m\u00e1s que los 25 mil millones que recaud\u00f3 Alibaba (la Mercado Libre china) cuando empez\u00f3 a cotizar. Hasta ahora era el r\u00e9cord.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hasta ahora nadie sabe cu\u00e1nto vale Aramco. Cuando cotice, el valor de sus acciones permitir\u00e1 calcular su capital. Se estima que valdr\u00e1 1,5 mill\u00f3n de millones de d\u00f3lares. Cuatro Productos Internos Brutos (PIB) de la Argentina. Todo el mundo est\u00e1 excitado. Ayer, por ejemplo, China indic\u00f3 que le interesar\u00eda invertir en diciembre entre 5.000 y 10.000 millones de d\u00f3lares. Las implicancias econ\u00f3micas son s\u00f3lo algunas. Las geopol\u00edticas, en esa regi\u00f3n del planeta, son inconmensurables.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Culpa de las bater\u00edas**\n&gt; \n&gt; \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 el gobierno \u00e1rabe -encabezado por el pr\u00edncipe heredero Mohamed bin Salm\u00e1n- quiere vender la joya de la corona que, entre impuestos y ganancias financia pr\u00e1cticamente la totalidad del reino?\n&gt; \n&gt; La respuesta resuena en Argentina. Arabia dice que quiere modernizar su econom\u00eda, diversificarla, abrirla al extranjero y recibir inversiones. Y los expertos agregan: Arabia quiere empezar a monetizar ya sus reservas petroleras porque teme que empiecen a valer cada vez menos.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aramco vale tanto porque nadie tiene tantas reservas de crudo (puede seguir extrayendo al ritmo actual durante 52 a\u00f1os) y porque su petr\u00f3leo es el m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil y barato de extraer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pero sobre ese futuro asegurado se presentan dos amenazas asociadas. Una, son las energ\u00edas renovables. Otra, la presi\u00f3n del ambientalismo.\n&gt; \n&gt; En lo primero, la clave son los autos el\u00e9ctricos. El problema no es s\u00f3lo que sustituyan al motor de combusti\u00f3n. Lo importante es que, cuando m\u00e1s coches el\u00e9ctricos haya, habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s capacidad instalada para guardar electricidad generada por el sol o por el viento. Hasta hoy, esa electricidad deb\u00eda consumirse de inmediato o se perd\u00eda. Cuando haya millones de autos con bater\u00edas de litio la humanidad tendr\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n, por primera vez, un acumulador gigantesco y descentralizado para guardar energ\u00eda solar o e\u00f3lica y consumirla cuando no haya sol ni viento. La masividad abaratar\u00e1 las bater\u00edas, que ir\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n a otros fines.\n&gt; \n&gt; En cuanto al ambientalismo, el calentamiento global no es una mentira. Y los gobiernos no pueden ignorar a electorados cada vez m\u00e1s comprometidos. Y Aramco y Arabia Saudita est\u00e1n al tope de la lista de m\u00e1s buscados. Se calcula que un 5% del carbono que se agreg\u00f3 al mundo desde 1995 sali\u00f3 de los pozos saud\u00edes.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Mejor plata en mano**\n&gt; \n&gt; En definitiva, vender Aramco (o una parte) implica anticipar los ingresos futuros que le dar\u00eda Aramco al reino si siguiera funcionando como ahora. Algunos expertos dicen que un pa\u00eds como Arabia tiene una ventana de 20 a 30 a\u00f1os para transformarse y aprender a vivir de otra cosa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Para Argentina, la cuesti\u00f3n es obvia. La promesa de Vaca Muerta, publicitada como \u201cla pampa extra\u201d que de pronto le \u201capareci\u00f3\u201d al pa\u00eds, es percibida como el hallazgo de un bot\u00edn que nos va a salvar.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pero para quienes piensan as\u00ed, ac\u00e1 va la noticia: quedan muy pocos a\u00f1os para aprovechar Vaca Muerta. No lo dice cualquiera. Lo dicen los due\u00f1os de Aramco.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vaca Muerta ya tiene m\u00e1s de 8 a\u00f1os de existencia. Y a\u00fan no es rentable. Todav\u00eda hay que subsidiar el gas que sale de all\u00ed. Y los pol\u00edticos que nos gobiernan parecen no darse cuenta de que si nos dormimos en los laureles vamos a estar listo para sacar el gas cuando ya nadie lo necesite.\n&gt; \n&gt; El gobierno que se va internacionaliz\u00f3 los precios del petr\u00f3leo y del gas, con lo que activ\u00f3 las inversiones y aument\u00f3 la producci\u00f3n como para que Argentina volviera a autoabastecerse. Pero el fracaso de su pol\u00edtica econ\u00f3mica lo forz\u00f3 en los \u00faltimos meses a volver a congelar tarifas y el crudo y a subvaluar el d\u00f3lar que liquida a los exportadores.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Tres caminos en el kirchnerismo**\n&gt; \n&gt; Y el gobierno que viene se debate entre un ala liberal y un ala populista. La primera est\u00e1 encabezada por Guillermo Nielsen y quiere blindar Vaca Muerta y completar de una buena vez lo que Macri comenz\u00f3: que se exporte gas masivamente, industrializado o no, para conseguir los d\u00f3lares que el pa\u00eds no sabe generar excepto con el campo. El problema de esto es que los hogares tendr\u00edan que pagar m\u00e1s caros el gas y la luz. Y las industrias vetustas no podr\u00edan seguir subsidiadas.\n&gt; \n&gt; La segunda ala es el viejo proteccionismo nacionalista peronista. Quiere hornallas gratis para felicidad del pueblo y energ\u00eda hipersubsidiada para la industria mercadointernista, sin escala e improductiva del conurbano bonaerense. El problema de esto es que, as\u00ed, nadie va invertir en gas.\n&gt; \n&gt; **La famosa Tercera Posici\u00f3n**\n&gt; \n&gt; En la c\u00fapula del albertismo, con ADN peronista al fin, se ilusionan con una tercera posici\u00f3n: que las petroleras puedan exportar todo lo que quieran y que ni siquiera est\u00e9n obligadas a traer los d\u00f3lares (as\u00ed nadie nadie se los expropia), a cambio de que surtan al mercado interno con gas (y electricidad generada con gas) baratos.\n&gt; \n&gt; El planteo tiene tres dificultades. Uno: la energ\u00eda argentina ya es en todas sus formas una de las m\u00e1s baratas del mundo. Los aumentos tarifarios que Macri y Fern\u00e1ndez esquivan son s\u00f3lo para que la energ\u00eda no vuelva a ser irrisoria.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dos: el negocio de dame gas gratis adentro y vend\u00e9 lo que quieras afuera puede andar si vendo 10 adentro y 90 afuera. Pero faltan a\u00f1os para desarrollar la infraestructura capaz de industrializar y transportar todo eso. Por ahora es al rev\u00e9s: 90 adentro y 10 afuera. Y entonces no es negocio.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tres: las petroleras del mundo van a estar ocupad\u00edsimas invirtiendo en el resto del planeta (empezando por Aramco) en pa\u00edses que ya se reconvirtieron y no mantienen industrias que todav\u00eda necesitan que les regalen la energ\u00eda ni empleos tan poco productivos como esas industrias que no generan lo suficiente para costear un precio realista de la energ\u00eda.

This doesn't feel like a good faith argument at all.  \n\nThese two parts in particular stick out to me as Olympic level mental gymnastics. \n\n&gt;The CFR in Germany is currently 0.276%, and even they aren't detecting asymptomatic cases. It is very likely that the true CFR is less than 0.1%, perhaps significantly less.\n\n[Italy has a case fatality rate of around 7-7.5%](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\\(20\\)30110-8/fulltext).  Another poster noted that South Korea, which by far has had the most success dealing with this thing is still seeing a CFR of 1%.  Should I take either of these examples and apply to it to all cases of Covid 19 outbreaks?  No, of course not.  Every situation is different.  Germany's CFR being low could be due to a number of factors, lower transmission, genetic components we have no understanding of yet, selection bias in the sample, a lag in deaths from the newness of the outbreak, and literally dozens of other things.  Experts don't know a ton, but they all seem to agree that it's deadlier than the flu.  [Global Covid CFR is probably around 1.4% conservatively.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032)  \n\n\n&gt;Now, people say that overwhelming the medical system will lead to a higher fatality rate, and that's likely true. \n\nYes\n\n&gt;But normal causes of hospitalization and death aren't going away either and the longer hospitals are in coronavirus mode the more likely you are to die of a heart attack or a stroke. \n\nOverwhelming hospitals will have folks dying of heart attacks, strokes, gall bladders bursting, gun shot wounds, and a myriad of other normally treatable conditions a hell of a lot more quickly than proactively mitigating the damage from Covid-19.  Burnt out healthcare workers make mistakes.  The economic damage from just letting the floodgates be unleashed would be tremendous, as bad or worse than taking the steps we are taking now.\n\n&gt;\"Flattening the curve\" and prolonging the epidemic might lead to fewer deaths due to lack of ventilators but more deaths due to internal bleeding while doctors are dealing with the pandemic.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of what every researcher says.  If we don't flatten the curve and we have a 76% infection rate with 20% requiring hospitalization that would put us at 50 million people in need of hospitalization.  \n\nThat's 50 times more hospital beds than we would have in a best case scenario.  We might have 924,000 hospital beds in the entire country.  \n\nIf we have 50 million hospitalizations between now and August how the fuck is the hospital going to have time for anything else?  Not to mention that we would have a significantly higher mortality rate for Covid-19 itself because there's no way we are going to be able to supply a million or more respirators between now and the end of April when they would likely be needed.  \n\nThis doesn't even account for personnel shortages nationwide.  500,000 ICU nurses for 50 million patients over 6 months?  Not to mention these folks are almost certainly themselves going to get sick and be unable to perform their job.  What about the doctors?  We have a doctor shortage in the US as things stand today.  We only have around 30 doctors per 10k people in the US and not all of them are hospital docs.  Even if they all wen to treating Covid-19 cases full time we only have a million doctors for 50 million cases across a country nearly the size of Europe.\n\nTake that case up against a rosier scenario where we have extreme measures in place.  A 20% infection rate limits hospitalization to 13,160,000.  We would still struggle immensely and it would require a fuckload of work to manage 13 million new folks in American hospitals, but it would at least be somewhat possible.  \n\nI know my tone is super combative and for that I do apologize, but holy shit just listen to the experts.  Not listening to the experts is why we are in this mess in the first place.  They seem to think it's a serious fucking problem and they spend a lot more time working on this than internet shitposters on Reddit do.  \n\n!ping DUNK", "subreddit": "neoliberal", "created_utc": 1584831888, "id": "fl59zzi", "author": "Iamreason", "link_id": "t3_fmb1p4", "parent_id": "t1_fl53bt6", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "I think the biggest problem is that people totally underestimate this sickness.   \nHere are the similarities:\n\nIt is stealthy and after an inital \"very mild flu / sore throat\" it fades away into a latency phase.

Here is my (horror) story:\n\nI had always heard from my father that it is a bad idea to live with a close friend.  But, much to my detriment, I didn't listen. I have so many health issues that I am on medical leave from school and had to move out (THANK GOD..) I am in college and haven't had the best year. At all. The only thing good that happened was finally moving out. My landlord let me out of the lease nice and easy because her family was giving him grief about me, trying to get him to kick me out. Over the year, I have had a lot of health problems that my roommate, would tell her mom behind my back and her mom would tell the landlord. It is none of his business that I am sick. It is none of your business to gossip about me behind my back. This sort of behavior (having her mom call the landlord or my mom to complain) occurred over the whole year last year. She would tell me to my face (multiple times) to just kill myself when I was really depressed and that I was making my pain up for attention... I have fibromyalgia and in the morning I am sometimes in so much pain I wake up screaming and crying. She would constantly make me feel bad because of my depression or pain and told me that I was just lazy (I have both b12 and iron deficiency anemia so I am exhausted and need a lot more sleep than most people) and needed to \"snap out of it...\" That isn't how depression works at all.\n\nEventually, I was so depressed, suicidal, and dysfunctional that I had to go to the hospital for a week. My roommate didn't visit me once, and told her whole family that I was in rehab for drugs and had her mom call my mom about it. I was so depressed and in physical pain (fibromyalgia) I couldn't function. It wasn't drugs at all. All tests for drugs came back negative even. My college forced me to go.\n\nShe came home (after the summer) to a messy house and her mom called my mom and the landlord about it, they took pictures and sent them to my mom and dad, even though I hadn't been living there for over a month. I was away for the summer. It wasn't me but my boyfriend, and had my roommate actually talked to me about it like an adult, instead of pussying out and going behind my back she would have known this and saved my mom a lot of aggravation with my roommate's family. She told her mom to tell the landlord behind my back, after signing a lease that said it was okay for me to have a bunny, that even though she had been living with my pet bunny for a year (and he was never outside of my room,)  she didn't like the bunny and she made him tell me that I couldn't have the rabbit anymore. What was I supposed to do, just put him in a shelter? She knows that I love the bunny so much, and was just trying to get me to leave because she knew I wouldn't live somewhere without the bunny. She should have just talked to me about any problems she had. That isn't for the landlord to get involved with, that is between us two roommates. Luckily I needed a medical leave of absence and intend to transfer schools anyway, but if she had a problem with it or me, she shouldn't have signed the lease with me again in the first place.\n\nShe also currently blocked me on most social media and is lying to the landlord about my boyfriend who is on the lease as well, trying to get him evicted. She/her family lied and told the landlord that we were really disruptive (not true, we never get into loud arguments or play loud music late at night or anything like that) and that he left the house and my room a total mess. Which happened before they moved in for this next term, but no one else was living there and he had work plus a stomach flu which lasted for a week (I got it after he did and I was vomiting and miserable for like 6 days straight,) so he couldn't clean as often as he wanted to for a week or so. Granted it was pretty bad in the pictures they took of the house, but besides that one thing, he cleaned the rest of the year that he lived there. But he didn't leave the room a total mess and neither did I. She also tried to pin a bunch of other things on him that weren't true and continues to talk shit about me to the landlord. She told him I \"stole\" her friend's keyboard, which she left over the summer and it never got used anyway. Our old roommate took it by mistake (she thought it was hers, there were two keyboards) when she moved out in July to go back to China. I am prescribed medication and I guess a few pills were under the drawers/bed after I left. I kept my meds in a drawer under the bed and if I dropped one it would fall. I tried to clean under the bed as best as I could, but I couldn't really do it without taking the bed apart. She told the landlord that they were my boyfriend's \"illegal drugs.\" This was just false. The pills were mine because I was prescribed them. They took apart all of the furniture which I left in my room and told the landlord that my boyfriend and I had left the bedroom a \"total mess\" before I moved out, which is NOT TRUE AT ALL. My mom and I cleaned EVERYTHING, there was nothing left in my room except for the bed, which I left for my boyfriend who still intended to live at the property. He is just gone for one month. My mom is insulted by this comment. I had drawers under my bed and the only thing that we had a difficult time cleaning was under the bed because of the drawers. She exaggerated the mess of my room because she doesn't want to live with him anymore. \n\n \n\nMy landlord even performed a \"self-help\" eviction as a result of her comments and locked my boyfriend out (or at least told him he did) without a formal eviction notice, which is illegal in the state of NJ. You can't just kick/lock someone out because one roommate decides after signing a lease that they all of a sudden don't want to live with them anymore. There are leases and evictions for a reason and the landlord doesn't have any actual grounds to evict him on except things that he heard from her/her family which weren't true. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE WITH ME ANYMORE. HER AND HER FAMILY WERE TRYING TO GET ME TO MOVE OUT, SHE HAD HER FAMILY TALK TO THE LANDLORD BEHIND MY BACK ABOUT MY RABBIT? WHO WAS ONLY IN MY ROOM ANYWAY AND SHE HAD LIVED PEACEFULLY WITH HIM FOR OVER A YEAR? IT IS EVEN ON THE LEASE THAT I AM ALLOWED TO HAVE MY RABBIT!!! She just stopped talking to me with zero explanation as to why. I am so confused. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is some advice (which I received last year, but ignored) that I really think will be helpful to some of you, if not now but in the future!\n\nDon't live with your best friend.\n\nNo really, DON'T do this.\n\nIt can easily ruin your friendship and has the potential to make your life extremely difficult.\n\nAlso if you are over the age of 20 and are an adult (more or less haha) don't have your mother call or intervene with your friend's mom/family when you are even just a little unhappy about something. It doesn't solve any problems and only makes your friend and mom/family annoyed at YOU &amp; YOUR family, and has the potential to seriously ruin a friendship. Your tacky attempts to \"tattle\" on me for things I either: A. didn't do, or B. are really not that big of a deal, only make you/your mom look like crazy people who have nothing better to do then get your friend in trouble, because you are a spoiled princess and can't take anything less then \"perfect.\"\n\nMy mother knows that it is not her place to intervene in my friendship when I can work things out on my own, because I am not in Elementary school anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Don't live with your best friend (it can easily ruin the friendship) or have your mom call your friend's mom instead of working things out on your own if you are over the age of 18. Also don't sign a lease with someone if you don't want to live with them, and work things out with roommates on your own instead of having your family fight your battles.", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "created_utc": 1537602740, "id": "e6fd60z", "author": "demonicaboss", "link_id": "t3_9hwkxt", "parent_id": "t3_9hwkxt", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "&gt;As I have written, even the slightest improvement is an improvement.\n\nYet you had to go to population levels get any significant improvements.\n\nAnd even that is only part of the story.

As posted [the foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847)) \n\n\n&gt; my authentical sources\n\nMedical data &gt; anecdotes. Not to mention this medical data has a much larger n value than you, or a group of friends who may or may not be telling you their whole story.\n\n&gt;you need to stimulate your penis for a longer time, before you have orgasm.\n\nThere's many things wrong with this.\n\nFirst off, if that is your goal and values you are free to cut off parts of your own body. But that may not be someone else's goal or values, so you are not free to cut off parts of other people's bodies.\n\nSecond this ignores the different type of nerve endings in different parts of the penis:\n\n[\u201cThe glans penis is primarily innervated by free nerve endings and has ... cruder, poorly localized feelings (including pain, some temperature sensations and certain perceptions of mechanical contact). In the glans penis, encapsulated end-organs are sparse, and found mainly along the glans corona and the frenulum. **In contrast, the male prepuce ridged band at the mucocutaneous junction has a high concentration of encapsulated receptors.** The innervation difference between the protopathic sensitivity of the glans penis and the corpuscular receptor-rich ridged band of the prepuce is part of the normal complement of penile erogenous tissue.\u201d](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.0830s1034.x) There's a lot more on that too.\n\nThird is implicitly conflating orgasm with sensations before orgasm. The sole act of orgasming is not the totality of sexual pleasure. There is pre orgasm sensation that is missing. And it's not like pre orgasm sensation is a cumulative total resulting in orgasm, see again premature ejaculation or men who report they can go for hours.\n\nFourth is there's no data that it even makes somebody last longer. Since this is a key part of your arguments you are the one that has to substantiate this.\n\n\nFifth since you talked extensively on satisfying their girlfriends or wives, who is known as the world's best lovers? It's Europeans, who are not circumcised. In second place is South Americans, who are not circumcised. The real world perceptions go against your hypothesis.\n\nBut we have data on this too:\n\n\nMale circumcision and sexual function in men and women: a survey-based, cross-sectional study in Denmark.\n\n\n[\"Circumcised men...were more likely to report frequent orgasm difficulties after adjustment for potential confounding factors, **and women with circumcised spouses more often reported incomplete sexual needs fulfilment and frequent sexual function difficulties overall, notably orgasm difficulties and dyspareunia.**\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21672947)\n\nLogically, since you used that path, it makes perfect sense that the male and female genitalia have evolved to work together. These are literally the organs of reproduction, it would make no sense for there to be dysfunction here.\n\n\nFinally, you literally went on a dictator rant. You literally said if you had a chance to circumcise 1 million men *you would do it.* If you don't want to be accused dictator fallacy, then don't go on a dictator rant.\n\n\n&gt;fight against everything connected to religion\n\nStraw man fallacy.

Say a person na may sakit ay exposed everyday to a random set of people, say sa train ride, office, mall, resto-- after 5 days, theoretically, person A would have started a chain reaction of infection up to ~52 people.\n\nCONFIRMED CASES: GROWTH\n\nI did browse on the data ng China, Japan, Italy, S Korea, and observed na the growth of the number of confirmed cases per day is around 1.3x-1.5x. Madaming factors, but assuming we have the capability to test all PUIs and round up all those suspected, then the rate of growth sa confirmed cases should also follow that trend. Assuming, China, Japan, Italy and S Korea can be treated as parallel models ng Ph.\n\nAnd so far it follows. From 24 to 34 (34 ba?) confirmed cases, pasok siya sa 1.35x na factor.

Au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, les principales compagnies a\u00e9riennes - dont Delta Airlines, United Airlines et Southwest - ont utilis\u00e9 environ 96 % de leurs flux de tr\u00e9sorerie pour racheter des actions, selon Bloomberg. En r\u00e9duisant le nombre d'actions, ces rachats ont fait grimper le prix des actions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ce faisant, ils ont suscit\u00e9 des critiques sur la fa\u00e7on dont ils ont augment\u00e9 les rendements des actionnaires sans aider directement les entreprises.

Pour beaucoup, le rachat \u00e9tait simple : Ces entreprises choisissaient d'enrichir leurs actionnaires, plut\u00f4t que d'investir dans leurs activit\u00e9s et leur main-d'\u0153uvre.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Le sauvetage des compagnies a\u00e9riennes en cours rappellera sans doute aussi \u00e0 beaucoup le soulagement financier apport\u00e9 aux grandes banques de Wall Street \u00e0 la suite de la crise financi\u00e8re mondiale.

Voici 10 de leurs meilleurs choix.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TARP a investi environ 426,4 milliards de dollars et a finalement r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 441,7 milliards de dollars, r\u00e9alisant ainsi un profit pour les contribuables. Mais les d\u00e9tracteurs du programme ont fait valoir qu'il n'\u00e9tait assorti d'aucune condition et qu'il r\u00e9compensait Wall Street pour son mauvais comportement.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Certains l\u00e9gislateurs actuels tirent les le\u00e7ons du pass\u00e9 et pr\u00e9conisent des conditions de renflouement diff\u00e9rentes de celles d'il y a 12 ans. Le s\u00e9nateur Elizabeth Warren a exig\u00e9 des conditions plus strictes mardi, en disant que tout renflouement devrait exiger d'une entreprise qu'elle maintienne les salaires existants et qu'elle s'abstienne de racheter, de verser des dividendes et des primes aux dirigeants pendant au moins trois ans.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Il y a finalement une distinction cruciale \u00e0 prendre en compte, selon Sara Nelson, pr\u00e9sidente du syndicat de l'Association des agents de bord.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Nous ne laisserons pas cela ressembler au sauvetage des banques de 2008, et vous ne pouvez pas non plus comparer les deux\", a \u00e9crit Nelson sur Twitter. \"L'industrie a\u00e9rienne n'a pas caus\u00e9 la pand\u00e9mie et l'argent devrait \u00eatre assorti de conditions importantes pour aider les travailleurs et maintenir les avions en vol, et non pour enrichir les actionnaires ou servir de primes aux dirigeants\".", "subreddit": "france", "created_utc": 1584963685, "id": "fl9nv5p", "author": "filsdeBalkany", "link_id": "t3_fnijpk", "parent_id": "t3_fnijpk", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "On a very remote, majestic beautiful mountain lookout where we have been going since we were kids.

Health Impact News is a popular target of \"Lead Stories.\" Since this news release, however, several hospitals in China have begun to conduct trials on intravenous Vitamin C therapy, so it is hardly \"Fake News\" as Facebook is claiming. In fact, Facebook is the one guilty of promoting \"Fake News\" by erroneously claiming there is no proof that Vitamin C can help combat the Coronavirus, when in fact clinical research trials are well underway in China with ample evidence that should be shared with the public, and not suppressed, simply because U.S. sources in bed with Big Pharma do not want the public to have this information.\n\nhttps://vk.com/wall457174006_439\n\nLink to interesting thread where thinking people are discussing the coronavirus situation and its possible use by the west as a biological weapon for destabilizing the economy of China.\n\nhttps://www.moonofalabama.org/2020/02/open-thread-2020-15.html?cid=6a00d8341c640e53ef025d9b362934200c&amp;fbclid=IwAR1vQx4FNMoNerzrp__a0rqD1gn5w4-OrZQAwCDkzmOnPr-RGwWRs2_WBVw#comment-6a00d8341c640e53ef025d9b362934200c\n\nAll credit to Petri Krohn for collating the articles and conducting research on the Coronavirus situation.", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "created_utc": 1583055085, "id": "fj63np7", "author": "ClarityofSignal", "link_id": "t3_fbpkrm", "parent_id": "t3_fbpkrm", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "I also forgot to mention the HK dollar's peg to US dollars. That peg depends on HK's foreign reserves which has been in deep trouble. They are very likely to have to break that peg in the future and that will send shockwaves through their financial sector. With the peg in danger, capital will fly away even faster and businesses will be even more reluctant to come to HK.\n\nThis is indeed a disaster for Hongkongers, but most of them, at least most of the young ones, seem to value democracy and freedom over wealth. So this fight may be worthwhile for them. However, my fear for them is that they are too young to realize what they are giving up in exchange for this fight. This is not a game, there is no turning back from this. Things will not go back to normal if the protests stop, not by a long shot. Things will trend further and further away from normal in fact because the lost capital won't ever come back.\n\nHong Kong's prosperity will depend solely on Beijing benevolence in the future. No nation will military intervene on Hong Kong's behalf, the protestors are on their own. The protestors have no weapons, no real military resources. They are at the mercy of what Beijing wants to do. The only thing stopping Beijing from crushing the unrest like they did in Xinjiang is the international backlash they'll get. If all those foreign companies and foreign workers weren't in Hong Kong, the city would have been crushed long ago with protestors sent to \"reeducation camps\".\n\nBut the protestors have brought some real change already. The Taiwanese election last year could have easily gone to the pro-CCP party. The pro-CCP party was leading the polls until the Hong Kong protests took off. Now, it seems the entire island is heavily anti-CCP. And because the anti-CCP party won, and handled the response to covid19 so well, the Hong Kong protests may have indirectly saved a lot of Taiwanese lives as well as the Taiwan economy as a whole. If the pro-CCP party won, they surely wouldn't have shut down travel from China as quickly (if at all), and they would have had to try to hide the virus to cover for the lack of travel ban and failed to contain the virus outbreak.\n\nIt's all really interesting how so many things were set in motion by what seemed like random event. The protests were all started when a Hong Kong couple went on vacation to Taiwan and the boyfriend killed the girlfriend there. China used this as an opportunity to enact their extradition bill which allows them to grab criminals from other countries but also allows them to grab whoever they want from Hong Kong. So, some crazy guy killing his girlfriend on an island led to history making events unfolding.", "subreddit": "worldnews", "created_utc": 1584854755, "id": "fl654g5", "author": "Starcraftduder", "link_id": "t3_fmjssu", "parent_id": "t1_fl5z41q", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": true, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "tinfoil hat theory copied from another forum:\nI don't need uncle intel, we have had evidence emerge from medical reports on the virus indicating that it's 50% genetically modified material from epidemiologists. Not tin-foil hatters.\n\nI've known since January 25th, 2020 when virus samples were uploaded outside of China... that is when the medical researchers who have to come up with vaccines and treatments went ape-shit over what they discovered in the genome.\n\nIndia's report that got stamped out by the disinformation campaign was accurate, this has 4 HIV proteins, SARS/MERS and Encephlatitis proteins.\n\nIt is made from a Bat Coronavirus shell which highly mutates. The payload takes a person to serious at 20% meaning you have 1 in 5 chances (playing Russian roulette with a 5 chamber gun) that it might take you to serious/critical where medical attention is needed or you die.\n\nWith medical treatment, 20% becomes 6% despite the lies that the media is claiming at 2%. We've even heard the WHO say 20% to serious and 6% death even with medical treatment and it can be an entire month in a hospital until recovered.\n\nHowever, recovered but not cured is the part most of you are missing in the details. The virus likes to mutate just like HIV and change it's coronavirus outer sheath. This means as the body goes through the normal immune-loop to produce an anti-body for Generation 1 of the first infection after it tricked the body using HIV proteins to hide ie the asymptomatic 14 day - 30 day period (yes it's a bell curve and some people can go potentially longer than 30 days and be infectious without symptoms). The virus mutates and a new corona sheath is produced nullifying the first anti-bodies and the immune-loop process repeats.\n\nAnother click on the 1-5 chamber gun. The body resolves that, potentially a 14-20 day process and gets Gen-2 but by that time Gen3/Gen4/Gen5 may now exist the same loop, the same click of the gun. This is why HIV anti-virals appear to be the only working solution for doctors at the moment.\n\nYou catch this and theoretically could need to be on anti-virals for the rest of your life, just like AIDS patients.\n\nPart of it's genetically modified traits is an entirely new, never seen before in nature protein that deals with how it infects the body. This is why the R4.6-6.6 rating and 83% chance of being infected is so alarming. It's airborne, it's a small microbe 0.3% microns and just being around someone not showing symptoms can infect via them just breathing.\n\nOr if they use the toilet as it passes through fecal matter that another person using same bathroom is at high-risk of infection so public washrooms should be avoided if there is a cluster in your area.\n\nThe bottom line... the media is downplaying the severity of this but countries are preparing for it as in judge by what they do, not what they say. What they say are lies. What they do is more important in exposing that lie. You don't lock down 760 million people in China for the flu.\n\nWhat concerns some people who are working on this problem is that the virus although is only 20% to serious, because of the mutations it could theoretically be 100% fatal for anyone catching it without medical treatments over time.\n\nIt's still too early to confirm that so it's a very doomy theory. As I was told, this has the potential to wipe Humanity off the map and can become as common as the common cold now that it's part of our viral ecology.\n\nAdd to that, you can catch it multiple times, it's Noval no herd immunity meaning no one is immune. You might catch someone's Gen2/Gen3/Gen4 infection while you just have Gen1 causing much more severe chances of going critical and dying if you are around a big cluster of infection.\n\nIt was designed to kill, that is its job. It is a weapon. Not designed to give you a hug and kisses.\n\nThe reason why people are not alarmed, China is covering up the deaths, burning bodies en mass and lying. Iran had a leak that over 1400 are now dead as of yesterday and that number no doubt is higher today.\n\nOnce you present symptoms and you body recovers, the encephalitis portion of the protein sequence is attacking the nervous system where it's hard for blood to access and present antibodies, the nervous system infection is what is causing people who appear fine to suddenly drop into a seizure and die. That kick effect is pretty much sudden death as death can happen within a minute of that event.\n\nAssuming pneumonia and hypoxia (depleted oxygen) doesn't kill you (event 1) or organ failure ie heart attack, liver failure, etc (event 2)... if it's in your nervous system (event 3) will. It's a multi-tiered killer, lots of regions of the body this is affecting: Lungs, Organs, Nervous system.\n\nDeath can come from all three regions of infection and depending on the person this is also part of that bell curve so it seems about 6 days average after symptoms to go into critical but can be longer everyone is different and this also has gain-of-function meaning it gets nastier as it adapts to you and can become even more lethal not dropping traits but gaining traits as it evolves unlike a natural virus that can have a loss of function ie become harmless like the cold.\n\nThat is why this is real doom folks, not fake doom or fake news. It doesn't care what you believe... if I had a bunker right now I'd be in one but I don't. But many CEOs seem to be bugging out. It's the masses who don't know but trust me, lots of people in power know what this is.\n\nHowever the ministry of propaganda is controlling information ie the infodemic that the WHO talks about saying to them it's scarier than the virus but the reality is... it will expose the agenda or event 201 reality of this planned mass depopulation event.", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1582994709, "id": "fj3wcov", "author": "rockyharbor", "link_id": "t3_fbeqi2", "parent_id": "t3_fbeqi2", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, {"body": "1.

Another four cases were travel-related, while five cases were under investigation.\n\nIn 4 of the 41 cases, the infected person was hospitalized, the DPH said.\n\nThe new numbers were announced as word arrived Monday of cancellations of gathering of all kinds in Massachusetts, including lucrative Boston conventions with thousands of attendees whose spending would have bolstered the economy.\n\n\n\nThe annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) will be held virtually instead, through Wednesday. The conference draws about 4,000 attendees each year, said Mark Aurigemma, a convention spokesman.\n\nThe annual Directions conference, hosted by the International Data Corporation for about 1,000 analysts and scheduled to begin Tuesday, has also been canceled. The conference said it will be live-streaming the keynote addresses.\n\nThe Cognitive Neuroscience 2020 conference, slated to run from Saturday to next Tuesday, will be held virtually.

Celebrity guests will not accept gifts, letters or cards. All fans must use hand sanitizer before photo opportunities or autograph sessions. All surface areas will also be cleaned every 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cACE Universe wants to assure everyone of the precautions we are taking to ensure a safe weekend at ACE Comic Con Northeast,\u201d the organizers said.\n\nIn addition to conventions, various Massachusetts arts events are also being canceled.\n\nThe New England Folk Festival, which says it draws 2,500 attendees to Acton from around the world and features more than 1,000 performers, said it was also canceling its April 24-26 gathering due to coronavirus concerns.\n\n\u201cSometimes things change with alarming speed, and we are reduced to hoping that our heads would stop spinning.

The low testing numbers align with what passengers were told by officials during a Tuesday afternoon teleconference, citing a 30% acceptance rate for the novel coronavirus test, several passengers told The Chronicle.\n\n\u201cThese folks know they are in a 14-day quarantine, if they test positive they are further delayed until they test negative,\u201d said the official, who The Chronicle agreed not to name because they were not authorized to speak to the media, in accordance with the paper\u2019s ethics policy. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to stay. They want to be released.\u201d\n\nThose who spoke to The Chronicle said federal health officials dissuaded them from taking the test, saying if they had no symptoms during the mandatory 14-day quarantine, a test was unnecessary. The federal official and cruise passengers also said the test compliance would have been higher had tests been available to administer shortly after they were removed from the ship and sent to the base.\n\nThe low test numbers fly in the face of what government officials had promised after the passengers, many California residents, were removed from the stricken Grand Princess cruise line beginning March 9 and sent to military facilities across the country. Twenty-one people aboard the cruise ship tested positive while it was quarantined off the coast of California before docking at the Port of Oakland.\n\n\u201cWe will be testing everyone on that ship,\u201d Pence said March 6 in a White House briefing. Two days later, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is overseeing the Travis operation, also said passengers would be tested.\n\nBut it appears that most will return to their homes with no COVID-19 test results.\n\nIn response to a series of questions, a White House official told The Chronicle: \u201cNo one can be forced to be tested. All passengers were screened and all were offered testing.\u201d\n\nHowever, past court rulings indicate the government would be allowed to order testing for the coronavirus during a health emergency, said Dorit Reiss, a law professor at UC Hastings in San Francisco.\n\nStanford law professor Michelle Mello agreed, saying the government could force a test if there was an order that explained \u201cwhy testing is reasonable and necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrictly speaking, people do not have to comply with such orders, in the sense that we don\u2019t strap people to a hospital gurney and extract biospecimens from them,\u201d Mello said in an email. \u201cBut if they refuse, public health authorities can order them into isolation until such time as the period of dangerousness (contagiousness) has passed. They can also criminally prosecute them and seek imprisonment or fines.\u201d\n\nBrian Ferguson, a spokesman for California\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, said the state was told early on that passengers would be isolated and that those with underlying conditions, symptoms or higher risk factors would be tested.\n\nA statement from the Health and Human Services department said that the federal government can\u2019t force anyone to be tested, but said those at Travis can still opt for testing at a later date. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not return requests for comment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the governor of California knows they are not required to be tested when they are released into the community,\u201d the federal official said. \u201cIn reality, I don\u2019t know if anyone knows that they can decline.\u201d\n\nInfectious disease experts say so little is known about coronavirus that there are no \u201cbinary answers\u201d about whether testing should be required before someone is released from quarantine.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have 800 or so people re-seeding their communities when they are released,\u201d said George Rutherford, a UCSF professor of epidemiology. \u201cThere aren\u2019t absolutes ... a person could be mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic and still infectious.\u201d\n\nNow Playing:\nHere is what you need to know about the coronavirus.\nVideo: Manjula Varghese\nRutherford called the claims that federal test administrators were dissuading passengers from getting tested \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nJohn Swartzberg, a UC Berkeley infectious disease expert, said it\u2019s likely a 14-day quarantine would be sufficient, but he has other worries.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that we continue to get false information from Pence and others,\u201d Swartzberg said in an email. \u201cI am not concerned about the passengers as long as they are being released after 14 days of quarantine (past the incubation period).\n\nThe CDC reported that the incubation period lasts two to 14 days. However, some studies have indicated the contagious period could last longer.\n\nThe situation developed around March 13 after all the passengers had arrived at the Fairfield air base and federal officials wanted to begin swab testing. The tests were delayed, however, due to a lack of trained personnel, protective gear and test kits, the federal official said.\n\n\u201cIf they had been prepared and given us the option from day one we were here, there would\u2019ve been a much higher acceptance,\u201d said former Grand Princess passenger Robert Archer, who has been isolated with his wife, Marlene.\n\nWith a March 24 release date looming, the couple turned down the test Sunday. The tests were in a collection phase and it would have taken days for the test to come back, Archer said.\n\n\u201cIf no results were back by (our release date), we\u2019ll get delayed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get tested positive, then we\u2019re not released until we get two or three negative tests in a row, each with its own delay.\u201d\n\nPassengers were told when they arrived at Travis that it would be a 14-day quarantine. If you had no symptoms during that period, Archer said, \u201cyou were guaranteed your freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been clinging to that,\u201d he said. \u201cFor people here, the breaking point is fast approaching. The food is degrading. People are on edge.\u201d\n\nSwartzberg called the delay in test availability for not just Travis, but the entire country, \u201creprehensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe blame goes squarely on the executive branch of our government and two of its agencies, the (Food and Drug Administration) and the CDC,\u201d the professor said.\n\nThe federal official said at other bases with smaller Grand Princess contingents, the test decline rate was much lower.\n\nSince arriving at Travis, about 20 passengers have shown symptoms and have been quarantined away from others. Some of those people have tested positive. Many of those individuals, the federal official said, had access to common spaces at Travis with those refusing tests.\n\nOn Tuesday, six passengers in the larger population group were taken away by ambulance, the federal official said.\n\nOn Sunday morning, testers knocked on passenger Michelle Heckert\u2019s door. Later that day, despite being told it was unnecessary, Heckert and her grandparents got swabbed.\n\n\u201cThe CDC rep said don\u2019t take the test if you are asymptomatic,\u201d Heckert recalled. \u201cThey said 14 days is a generous amount of time for symptoms to manifest if you had it.\u201d\n\nShe said she was told it would take four to five days for results. Her family\u2019s release date is March 23.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to feel safe \u2026 for peace of mind,\u201d Heckert said. \u201cAnd we wanted to be able to tell people we\u2019d been tested when we were able to be released.\u201d\n\nMany passengers were surprised that declining the test was even an option, she said.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the testing of those who wanted it was completed, but no test had yet been returned due to a backlog. There are only 13 staffers at Travis trained to administer the test, and the base was still waiting for required protective gear to be delivered, the federal official said.\n\nArcher\u2019s anxiety has been rising with each day. He said there\u2019s been an average of three ambulance evacuations each day.\n\nIf they get out, Archer said he and his wife would return to their Excelsior District home and shelter in place like everyone else in the Bay Area, but they\u2019d have their own beds, food and surroundings. And they wouldn\u2019t be sharing facilities with other higher-risk Grand Princess passengers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same problem: There\u2019s one guideline by the federal government, another guideline from the state and another guideline from the local government,\u201d Archer said. \u201cIt\u2019s amounted to one big pissing match.\u201d", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584671777, "id": "fkzih8q", "author": "2ndtryagain", "link_id": "t3_flbc06", "parent_id": "t1_fkybeld", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": true}, {"body": "&gt;[The Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care just published the most extraordinary medical document I\u2019ve ever seen.](https://twitter.com/Yascha_Mounk/status/1237731864233807872)\n\n&gt;To help people from Germany to America understand what we\u2019re about to face, I am publishing translated extracts here.\n\n&gt;Background:\n\n&gt;A week ago, Italy had so few cases of corona that it could give each stricken patient high-quality care.\n\n&gt;Today, some hospitals are so overwhelmed that they simply cannot treat every patient. They are starting to do wartime triage.\n\n&gt;Here\u2019s the guidance for that.\n\n&gt;\"It may be necessary to establish criteria of access to intensive care not just on the basis of clinical appropriateness but inspired by the most consensual criteria regarding distributive justice and the appropriate allocation of limited health resources.\"\n\n&gt;\"This scenario is substantially comparable to the field of 'catastrophe medicine,' for which ethical reflection has over time stipulated many concrete guidelines for doctors and nurses facing difficult choices.\"\n\n&gt;\"In a context of grave shortage of medical resources, the allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care. \n\n&gt;It's a matter of giving priority to 'the highest hope of life and survival.'\"\n\n&gt;Recommendations: \n\n&gt;1) The extraordinary criteria of admission and discharge are flexible and can be adapted in accordance with the local availability of resources.\n\n&gt;These criteria apply to all patients in intensive care, not just those infected with CoVid-19.\n\n&gt;2) \"Allocation is a very complex and delicate choice. [\u2026] \n\n&gt;The foreseeable increase in mortality for clinical conditions not linked to the current epidemic due to the reduction of chirurgical activity and the scarcity of resources needs to be taken into consideration.\"\n\n&gt;3) \"It may become necessary to establish an age limit for access to intensive care. \n\n&gt;This is not a value judgments but a way to provide extremely scarce resources to those who have the highest likelihood of survival and could enjoy the largest number of life-years saved.\"\n\n&gt;\"This is informed by the principle of maximizing benefits for the largest number.\n\n&gt;In case of a total saturation of resources, maintaining the criterion of 'first come, first served' would amount to a decision to exclude late-arriving patients from access to intensive care.\"\n\n&gt;4)\"In addition to age, the presence of comorbidities needs to be carefully evaluated. It is conceivable that what might be a relatively short treatment course in healthier people could be longer and more resource-consuming in the case of older or more fragile patients.\"\n\n&gt;\"For patients for whom access to intensive care is judged inappropriate, the decision to posit a ceiling of care nevertheless needs to be explained, communicated, and documented.\"\n\n&gt;I spent many years sitting in seminar rooms thinking about questions of distributive justice.\n\n&gt;Let me be honest: It\u2019s left me not one bit wiser about what to do in these kinds of dramatic circumstances.

On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....\n\nGiven the patient\u2019s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC \u201cpersons under investigation\u201d case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.\nOn January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient\u2019s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.\n\nOn admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.\n\n\nOn days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient\u2019s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.\n\nTreatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.\n\n\nA chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.\n\n\nOn hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient\u2019s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nOn hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient\u2019s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. \n\nAs of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.\n\n\n(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and \u201cremains isolated at home.\u201d) see;\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-02-04/first-us-coronavirus-patient-released-from-hospital%3fcontext=amp\n\n\n(Please also see these relevant links contributed by r/u/Two_Luffas: \n\nThe JAMA related to the first story: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044\n\nHere's the Lancet case study from Jan. 24 : https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\n\nThe NEJM case study, but includes all of the relevant supporting documents: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191\n\nAnother Lancet case study: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930211-7/fulltext\n\nLancet case study from Nepal: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30067-0/fulltext)", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1583033033, "id": "fj5htkt", "author": "arewebeingplutoed", "link_id": "t3_fbnndn", "parent_id": "t1_fj5h9aj", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Hi Pikaea, the medium religiosity is my opinion, but naturally a person who is born and lives in UK have a more accurate view of it (I'm not such a person).

These animals had a high incidence of sudden death that correlated with transgene expression levels. \"\n\nYou can find more links yourself, just google \"sudden death syndrome ace2\".\n\nLook at the video again, what explains the seizure? The following link describes sudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac arrest can be associated with 10-20 seconds of seizure (which is what we see in this video).\n\nhttps://www.sca-aware.org/blog/scafoundation/sca-and-heart-attack-understanding-the-difference\n\n\"Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is different from heart attack. While heart attack is described as a \u201cplumbing problem,\u201d SCA is more of an \u201celectrical problem\u201d that prevents the heart from functioning effectively. Heart attack can lead to SCA, but there are many other causes, such as congenital abnormalities, severe heart failure, electrocution and drug overdose.\n\nWhen SCA occurs, the heart stops beating altogether. As a result, blood no longer is pumped throughout the body, including the brain. The person suddenly passes out, loses consciousness, and appears lifeless\u2014except for abnormal \u201cgasping\u201d which may last for several minutes.\n\nOccasionally, SCA victims will experience 10-20 seconds of seizure activity (shaking of the arms and legs) at the onset of the event as the brain stops receiving blood and oxygen from the heart.\"", "subreddit": "HongKong", "created_utc": 1582334230, "id": "fic00gb", "author": "trashytraveller", "link_id": "t3_f6zyo9", "parent_id": "t1_fia9dyz", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "We are looking at the nefarious nature of China's bureaucratic system: the local governments are dead afraid of any incidents that might shed negative light upon themselves in the eyes of the central government, a.k.a State Council of the People's Republic of China.\n\nWhile trying to resolve the matter by themselves, the locals would rather hush-hush said incidents than reporting to State Council.

In no cases do we just allow an individual to decide on whim whether they will retaliate against a said action.  \n\nClearly breaking into someone house is a crime and may be met with force.   But it is a crime whether the victim chooses to retaliate or not.\n\n&gt;So, your position is that individuals are not the determiner of whether they are justified in retaliating... and the courts are not, either?

It's the topic we are discussing.\n\n&gt;Yes, but only within the context of proportionality and not in the case of deliberately putting yourself in harms way in order to compel the action of another. In other words, if you go visit someone who has the coronavirus, you cannot expect to \"defend\" yourself from them, on their own property, while you were the one putting yourself in contact with them. That would also apply if someone with the coronavirus was visiting a 3rd party and you also visit that 3rd party. It would be up to you to leave the property of the 3rd party person, rather than you forcing the coronavirus infected person to leave.\n\nBut visiting the third party or leaving his home is exactly the situation we are discussing.  Should the state be able to use force to prevent him from visiting others or leaving his home?  If his acts are aggressive then the state is justified in using, what may then be, retaliatory force against him.  So would I.

She was told Feb. 19 that if she does not accept the new position in 15 days, which is March 5, she would be terminated.\n\nThe whistleblower has decades of experience in the field, received two HHS department awards from Azar last year, and has received the highest performance evaluations, her lawyers said.\n\nThe complaint was filed Wednesday with the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal watchdog agency. The whistleblower\u2019s lawyers provided a copy of a redacted 24-page complaint to The Washington Post. A spokesman for the Office of the Special Counsel said he could not comment on complaints filed with the office.\n\nThe complaint alleges that HHS staff were \u201cimproperly deployed\u201d and were \u201cnot properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation.\u201d The complaint also alleges that the workers were potentially exposed to coronavirus because appropriate steps were not taken to protect them, and staff were not trained in wearing personal protective equipment, even though they had face-to-face contact with returning passengers. The workers were in contact with passengers in an airplane hangar where evacuees were received and on two other occasions: when they helped distribute keys for room assignments and hand out colored ribbons for identification purposes.\n\n\u201cWe take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act. We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time,\u201d HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said.\n\nIn her complaint, the whistleblower states that \u201cappropriate steps were not taken to quarantine, monitor, or test [the workers] during their deployment and upon their return home.\u201d The repatriated Americans were among those evacuated from Wuhan and quarantined on military bases in California and Texas because they were considered at high risk for contracting the flu-like illness.\n\nAbout 14 ACF personnel were sent to March Air Force base in Riverside County, California, and another team of about 13 ACF personnel were sent to Travis Air Force in Fairfield, California, according to the complaint and the whistleblower\u2019s lawyer, Ari Wilkenfeld. Several people within HHS voiced objection to sending the ACF personnel to receive passengers, according to a person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\nA second person familiar with the situation said the workers were not tested for coronavirus because none of them met the criteria for testing, which only calls for testing people who had recent travel to China or contact with a confirmed case. The workers also did not exhibit any symptoms, the person said. If they had, appropriate protocol would have been followed.\n\nThe deployments took place Jan. 28 to 31, around the time when the first planeload of evacuees arrived at March, and Feb. 2 to Feb. 7, during the time when additional flights were arriving at Travis. The planes each carried about 200 Americans who were repatriated from Wuhan.\n\nAfter their deployments, the workers returned to their normal duties, some taking commercial airline flights to return to their offices around the country, the lawyers said.\n\n\u201cOur client was concerned that ACF staff \u2014 who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus \u2014 were allowed to leave quarantined areas and return to their communities, where they may have spread the coronavirus to others,\u201d said Lauren Naylor, one of the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers.\n\nThe whistleblower is also seeking assistance from the office of Rep. Jimmy Gomez, (D-Ca.), a member of the House Ways and Means committee and vice chair of the House Oversight Committee, according to a Gomez spokesman.\n\nDuring a hearing Thursday, Gomez asked Azar whether any employees from the Administration for Children and Families could have been sent to help with the repatriation of Americans from Wuhan, China without any training in emergency response. Azar replied that some ACF employees were involved.\n\nAsked what sort of health and safety training the personnel received, and whether any of them were exposed to high-risk evacuees from China, Azar said: \u201cThey never should have been without P.P.E,\u201d referring to personal protective equipment.\n\nAsked whether any protocols may have been broken, given the urgency on the ground, Azar replied that urgency was never a reason for breaking safety protocols.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that has taken place,\u201d Azar said said, adding that health and safety protocols \u201cshould always be followed.\u201d He said that he did not personally know the names of the team, but that other department officials did. Pressed by Gomez what the department would do if untrained employees were exposed to the virus, Azar said: \u201cI\u2019d want to know the full facts, and we\u2019d take appropriate remedial efforts.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower said she received an email Jan. 25 about a potential deployment within ACF to support repatriation of the evacuated Americans, according to her lawyer. She initially supported the efforts because they had the \u201cappearance that this was within ACF\u2019s scope,\u201d lawyer Lauren Naylor said. But later, she discovered the personnel were dispatched without her knowledge by other senior officials at HHS. It was part of the agency\u2019s \u201call-hands-on-deck\u201d mission, Naylor said, but it broke agency protocol about what kinds of employees should respond to health emergencies. The whistleblower said she later found out about the deployment when she heard directly from some employees and other senior officials at HHS.\n\nSome workers expressed concern about the lack of protective gear to the ACF team leader on the ground. That person joined ACF in September and had \u201cno training or experience in any federal emergency management, public health emergency response, or safety or operational protocols to run the mission,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nACF personnel typically deal with supporting people recovering from natural disasters, such as floods and fires, and helping victims apply for temporary assistance, all of which are under the category of human services, the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers said. HHS officials broke established protocols for emergency support by sending ACF workers to a health emergency, for which they have no training, Naylor said. The Administration for Children and Families, which has about 1,300 employees, has come under attack in recent years because of its role in sheltering and taking custody of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border who were separated from them by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cShe was involuntarily assigned to a position in a subject matter where she has no expertise,\u201d said Wilkenfeld, her lawyer, in an interview Thursday. The agency said the reason for the reassignment was \u201cnecessary to meet the needs of the department,\u201d according to a memo she received. \u201cIf I did not accept involuntary reassignment, I would be terminated from federal service through adverse personnel action,\u201d according to her complaint.", "subreddit": "worldnews", "created_utc": 1582843184, "id": "fiynzen", "author": "8008135__", "link_id": "t3_faj6y9", "parent_id": "t3_faj6y9", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Unlikely, seeing as a majoprity of Trumps support comes from old people who happen to be the most vulnerable to the cornoavirus.

Despite the media and governmental attention on Shincheonji, they have only been half of the problem.\n\n\nI. The alarm bells didn\u2019t work, the containment measures were poor:\n\n\nReuters has a very informative infographic site\u00a0https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-SOUTHKOREA-CLUSTERS/0100B5G33SB/index.html. Basically, the first untraceable community cases were patient 29 and 30, who were admitted to Seoul National Hospital on 16th Feb. This means that patient 29 and 30 were infected at around the beginning of Feb. Whether they are related to Shincheonji or not, this should have been a warning alarm for the South Korea healthcare authorities, but it unfortunately wasn\u2019t.\n\n\nPatient 31 was a member of Shincheonji. She started to show symptoms sometime around Feb 10th, meaning that like case 29 and 30, she was infected sometimes in end of Jan and beginning of Feb. On the 15th, doctors advised her to to test for coronavirus, but she didn\u2019t listen, went to several other places. On the 17th, she went to the hospital to test for covid-19 and was tested positive. She was subsequently assumed to be a super spreader and blamed to the subsequent rise of infected cases.\n\n\nBut was she really a super spreader? The epidemic didn\u2019t just suddenly come into existent in South Korea without at least 1 imported case getting through unchecked. Right after patient 31 was discovered, a score of people were subsequently discovered to be infected. On the 19th, the total number of people infected was 51 people. On the 20th, it was 104 people. By that time, the infection was widespread enough inside Daegu for a random military personnel with no known connection to Shincheonji visiting his home to catch it and go on infecting several others inside the military, which should have been the reserve resources when the epidemic spread nationally but was, in actuality, compromised and deactivated early on. These people weren\u2019t infected the day before they were discovered. They were infected sometime between 2 weeks ago, at the beginning of Feb.. From then on, the reported infected cases have started to climb on a very clearly exponential graph. Despite the media attention, it was very clearly that patient 31 was unlikely to be the cause of the infection for the people discovered on the 19th and 20th but they all were likely to be infected at around the same time, at the end of Jan and beginning of Feb. The disease has been silently transmitting among the populace for half a month, the alarm bell of which should have been the discovery of patient 29 and 30, never mind patient 31. Unfortunately, even when patient 31 started to show symptoms, there was no action from the South Korean government and healthcare authorities to at the very least quarantine the suspected case from going all over the place. In hindsight, they were basically choosing the rights to be idiots of the Shincheonji cult over the health of 5300 (and counting) South Korean citizens.\n\n\nFurthermore, in the Reuters graphic, you can see that there are at least 4 clusters in development: Shincheonji, Cheongdo Daenam Hospital, Busan Onchun Church, and others. Cheongdo Daenam Hospital was also where the brother of the Shinchoeonji leader died and had a funeral from January 31 to February 2, and the brother died of, you guessed it, pneumonia. To sum it up, somebody died of pneumonia in the middle of an epidemic and no healthcare authorities moved to verify whether the dead had covid-19 or not and allowed said funeral to last 3 days with several thousands visitors in a hospital with lots of patients in the mental ward and immuno-compromised and old people, a place where would be the most dangerous source of transmission if compromised. Which it was.\n\n\nFurthermore, even after Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk blew up, as of Feb 25th, 8 days after patient 31 tested positive and it became clear that Shincheonji was a part of the problem, the South Korean government refused to restrict travel from Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk to other provinces and countries just because \u201cChina did it so it must be bad and human rights violation.\u201d I kid you not, an excerpt from Washington Post\u00a0https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-south-korea-a-region-is-stricken-with-coronavirus-but-no-china-style-lockdowns-planned/2020/02/25/a0e90bf0-57b8-11ea-8efd-0f904bdd8057_story.html\u00a0\n\n\n\"When a spokesman for South Korea's ruling party suggested Tuesday that the government would be rolling out a \"maximum lockdown\" on the coronavirus-hit southern city of Daegu, the backlash was immediate and the political retreat swift.\n\n\nHong Ihk-pyo soon clarified that he didn\u2019t mean a \u201cWuhan-style lockdown\u201d or a blockade on travel into and out of the city \u2014 along the lines that China\u2019s Communist Party has imposed on Wuhan and surrounding areas at the center of the covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in soon chimed in. There would be no regional blockade, he said, only a full-scale effort to contain the spread of the virus.\n\n\nThe measures include tracing and testing potential carriers, canceling large public gatherings and marshaling the country\u2019s medical and financial resources, with help from the police and the military.\n\n\nBut as South Korea struggles to contain a rapid acceleration in coronavirus infections, one thing is clear: The kind of tactics imposed by the authoritarian regime in China are simply not on the menu in this compact, democratic and politically outspoken country.\n\n\nOf South Korea\u2019s nearly 1,000 confirmed cases of the disease named covid-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, 543 are in Daegu and another 248 in the neighboring province of North Gyeongsang \u2014 with a major burst of cases linked to a megachurch. All but one of the 11 deaths have taken place in the city or province.\n\n\n\u201cSome kind of travel restriction on Daegu citizens might have been helpful to contain the virus, but it was just out of the question,\u201d said Choi Eun-hwa, a professor of medicine at Seoul National University and a member of an expert panel that met Moon on Monday. \u201cThe South Korean government can\u2019t afford to enforce that kind of restriction, as it would spark a huge backlash.\u201d\n\n\nYeah and as far as I know they still haven\u2019t restricted travel from Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk as of now, March 4th, when the number of infected has surpassed 5300, the epidemic has spread to all South Korean provinces, a hospital in Seoul became a new cluster of 14 reported confirmed cases after importing a case from Daegu, while China is well on its way for recovery in part thanks to its strict travel restriction measures both inside the country and to other countries.\n\n\nAt the end of January, China placed a travel restriction on Chinese nationals in China from going on tours to other countries. On February 25th, the South Korean government accused the Vietnamese government of quarantining 20 Korean nationals from Daegu to Vietnam without prior notice in the middle of a pandemic, when the number of cases in South Korea was in the 800. The South Korean media subsequently labeling countries (with special focus on Vietnam) that have imposed travel restriction on travelers from South Korea \u201cKoreaphobic\u201d despite anyone with eyes can see that the epidemic was blowing up fast in South Korea, and the South Korea government still hadn\u2019t restricted travel for its nationals within the country and to other countries. In comparison, despite China\u2019s initially putting pressure on countries that had put a travel ban on travelers from China, China\u2019s response and travel ban of its citizens to other countries, even if a bit late, was downright charitable.\n\n\nTo sum up part 1: The South Korean government\u2019s lack of containment measures when things start to go off the rail made the epidemic uncontainable now, and the 4 alarm bells within 2 weeks didn\u2019t work.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583544442, "id": "fjp8ia9", "author": "byebyebyd", "link_id": "t3_felrni", "parent_id": "t3_felrni", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": true}, {"body": "The reliable information we get from some countries  is limited.

You can keep claiming that they're cooperating all you want, kiddo.  It doesn't change the fact that the overwhelming majority of the reports are stating they aren't.

Once the red cells are split out, in most counties they do a step call leukoredction of the blood (aka remove white cells), but in America it typically isn\u2019t done.

Many hoped the threat of Covid-19 would prompt an honest conversation to address the issue of critical care capacity and our ability to look after our sickest patients. By repeating \u2018the NHS is well prepared to deal with coronavirus\u2019, it seems that yet again doctors\u2019 concerns have been brushed under the carpet.\u201d\n\nShare your story\n\nShare your stories\n\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. \n\nBased on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.\n\nBut some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.\n\nThe third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.\n\nFor most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good.

I certainly applaud their approach, it is a great move, I'm just not sure what this means for Canada.\n\n&gt; They have very low number of cases and have largely contained the outbreak, here its almost a joke when talking about it. No one i know has a clue what to do, when to stay home, what are the onset symptoms. Where the infected travelled. Who knows how many people have been infected, got symptoms but thought it was the flu because they couldn't trace the steps of the infected.\n\nTo be fair that's also MUCH harder to do when you're the 2nd largest country in the world. Advice given to people in Hong Kong and Singapore will be relevant to 90% of people in HK and Singapore, but advice given Canada-wide will likely only be relevant to 20% of the people, if that.\n\nThe relevant advice is always wash your hands, don't cough uncovered, keep distances, don't shake hands. If you travel and you're sick, call hospitals, they'll test you.\n\nWhat more do you think should be said or done?\n\n&gt;Who knows how many people have been infected, got symptoms but thought it was the flu because they couldn't trace the steps of the infected.\n\nOne of the signs that this happens (called community spreading) is if someone comes to the hospital with covid-19 symptoms, the hospital tests them and confirms they have the virus, and they find out the person didn't travel and get it abroad. If they can't trace where exactly this person got the infection from, that means it is spreading within the country.\n\nThere are measures in place for this already.\n\n&gt;When comparing the two countries with Canada we are doing everything reactive.\n\nNo we aren't. See [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/ffcv95/canadas_response_has_been_exemplary_when_it_comes/fjybl12/) two [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/ffcv95/canadas_response_has_been_exemplary_when_it_comes/fjyac74/).\n\n&gt;i have yet to hear anything proactive in our approach to the virus.\n\nJust because you don't hear it, doesn't mean it's not happening. Are you a doctor? An epidemiologist? Are you somehow involved in the medical field? Do you know what the actual guidelines and procedures are?\n\nJust because you don't hear it, doesn't mean it's not happening. Health Canada is hard at work, and so far is on the ball. Don't get me wrong, I know it will hit the fan soon, the disease is already spreading like mad in the US and it will make its way up into Canada sooner rather than later. It is impossible to stop that from happening. At present however Health Canada is doing a great job finding and isolating the sick people to prevent an outbreak. It can't save us, but it can delay the progress of the disease so we don't look like Italy or Iran just yet.\n\n&gt;You mentioned Iran but when the first case popped up in BC our health officials were blind sided with the news.\n\nDefine \"health officials\". Do you mean ministers and people working in government? Or do you mean the actual medical experts? There's a very big difference between the two. Doctors talk to each other as part of their job, and they know what's going around. Health officials as government workers have a much more rigid hierarchy and strictly defined roles, so information goes slower through the government. This is normal and unfortunately unavoidable.\n\n&gt;Every time it was an announcement about finding a case it was because they got sick and called the health authorities these were people had traveled abroad, walked into Canada, and pushed off calling until they were too sick.\n\nHow else are they supposed to find who is or isn't sick? If Canada can do 4,000 covid-19 tests a day, and 50,000 people enter and leave the country a day, how are you supposed to find who is sick?\n\nWhat the experts have done is decide to focus those efforts on people who are actually sick, and telling the population at large to call the hospitals if they have worries. You can't just 'find' who is sick, it takes time-consuming and expensive tests to do that, and testing everyone at random is inefficient. Instead, you follow up on people who are sick find them, isolate them, find everyone who was in contact with them, get them to self-isolate, and monitor the situation closely so the disease doesn't spread. That's exactly what Health Canada has done. This isn't just reactionary doing nothing. This is pro-actively following a well-researched plan that allows for quickly and efficiently isolating patients to prevent outbreaks from happening in the population at large, and so far it's been working.\n\nWe have one case in BC that we can't trace the disease to outside travels, or to people who have travelled. That means there likely is community spreading, and now Health Canada is going to jump on that and target that area to try and contain and isolate people before there is an outbreak. This is where the kind of communication from Singapore and Hong Kong become relevant and important, because that's what you do when you have an actual outbreak as opposed to just sick people coming in from abroad.\n\nIf it spreads in BC, and it probably will, that's when you can see what exactly health Canada is doing in BC and if they're being proactive enough. So far they caught every fireball thrown our way and prevented a wildfire. There was nothing else to do. Now we're starting to have a fire domestically, so let's see if we'll be able to contain it, yeah?\n\n&gt;Now its community infections, people arent going to be that cognitive to call in, as it will be the flu until things get bad for them.\n\nAnd now is also a great time to put together more informative pamphlets and distribute the information more efficiently. If you tell people to prepare and plan, but nothing happens for a month, they tend to forget the plan. If we still fail to communicate to people effectively from now on that's a serious problem, but it hasn't been a problem *yet*.\n\n&gt;Now the steps that Singapore took many not be the best course for us because the that method for tracking is about creating the web of connection, it only works if you control the input (i.e. border controls) if you have unknown leak plugging one hole wont fix the issue. We messed up our response plan and simple.\n\nYou can't expect Canada to take the same approach as Singapore, it would be like telling a farmer they shouldn't use pesticides and should simply go and pick the weeds by hand, after all you do it in your garden and it works fine right?\n\nThe two situations are completely different. It is all about knowing that web of connection, and that's exactly what Health Canada has been doing, and exactly how they know that there is come community spreading in BC right now. Again, just because you don't see Health Canada being proactive, doesn't mean it's not happening.\n\nThe thing with border control is that it doesn't work. You can only tell who is sick until after they start showing symptoms. In Canada we also can't close the border without immediately crashing the economy, and it's also not going to make a difference anyways. The disease is spreading like mad in the US, and it will make its way north into Canada from there no matter what we do.\n\nHealth Canada hasn't failed by allowing community spreading in BC. Health Canada has succeeded in delaying outbreaks until now. It was never going to be a question of stopping the disease from getting into Canada, the moment it infected more than 10 countries it would be impossible to prevent it from spreading world-wide. Coronavirus is more contagious than the flu, the symptoms are non-specific, it looks like the flu, it takes 1-4 weeks from the moment you're infected to present symptoms, and you can spread the disease without showing any symptoms. Those are literally all the worst things a virus can have to make it an epidemiologist's nightmare, the only thing that could make it worse is if it was carried by say birds.\n\nSo yeah, the disease was going to make its way into Canada sooner or later. The fact we don't currently look like Italy or Iran is due to Health Canada being proactive and containing the disease early on, unlike China who didn't act fast enough, and unlike the US which is still denying that it's happening in the first place.\n\nWe have not messed up our response plan, our response plan is working exactly as intended to delay outbreaks in Canada.

Climate variability is responsible for at least 30% of the annual fluctuations in worldwide agricultural yield. Under \u201cnormal\u201d climatic conditions, the global food system can compensate for local crop losses through grain storage and trade. However, it is doubtful whether the current system is resilient to more extreme climatic conditions. Climatic shocks to agricultural production contribute to food price spikes and famine, with the potential to trigger other systemic risks, including political unrest and migration.

Researchers identified warming temperatures and shorter winters as one of the reasons. Also, the change in weather allowed ticks to invade areas that had previously been too cold for them to live.\n* West Nile virus: Temperatures soared this past summer in Europe. At the same time, there was a sharp spike in West Nile virus infection \u2013 with more than 400 cases reported. Health experts believe the two are connected. The disease is spread by mosquitoes that have fed on infected birds, and warmer temperatures have helped to start the transmission season early. \n* Malaria: In Ethiopia and Colombia, scientists observed that malaria\u2019s range shifted to warmer areas between 1990 to 2005. In part because the transmitting mosquito thrives in the heat. But also, because the parasite that causes malaria reproduces faster inside the vector mosquito when the weather is warmer.\n* Flesh-Eating Bacteria: It\u2019s not just humans who enjoy a nice swim in the ocean when the weather is hot. Flesh-eating bacteria called vibriosis flourish in warm seawater. As temperatures climb and sea levels rise, they increase in number and can infect people through open wounds or by contaminating popular seafood like oysters.

The problem is if the wages of the bottom half of America stay the same than the prices of things keep increasing but their money they're making doesn't.\n\nThat only applies for the things that \"the wealthy\" buy.\n\nSure, if the extremely wealthy have lots more money, the price of a Lamborghini goes up.  That doesn't affect the lives of the non-wealthy except in the sense that if some of them happen to work for the Lamborghini company, it can now afford to pay them better.\n\nThe price of milk and bread and a pair of sneakers doesn't change.\n\n&gt; you look at the price of a can of Coke back in the fifties and it was like $0.05. A map that increase in that price from the 1950s the 2016 vs the amount of the minimum wage increase from the 1950s to 2016 is not equal. The cost of the can of Coke went up more in the minimum wage. so somebody working minimum wage in 2016 is paying a larger share of their income for a can of Coke than somebody who was working minimum wage in 1950\n\n[The problem with your example is that the cost of a coke in the 1950s isn't really a 1950s price, it is an 1886 price.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_price_of_Coca-Cola_from_1886_to_1959)  Its hard to find a better example of cherry-picking.\n\nThat said, only about 1% of full time workers earn minimum wage, and wages are currently rising faster than inflation - fastest for the low end.\n\nWhat will make them rise even faster is securing the border and removing the illegal aliens currently in the country.\n\n&gt; but acting like we need to sacrifice everybody else in the countryy just to pay down this imaginary debt (yes. it's imaginary. it only exists on a computer on a ledger. it's all theoretical money that hasnt even been physically printedd) just not going to work..\n\nIt isn't imaginary, unfortunately.  The money in the Social Security Trust fund is imaginary - the government took and spent that decades ago, and all that's in there now is IOUs.\n\nThe national debt is very real and $trillions of it is owed to other countries.  We spent $375 billion last year making interest payments on it.  In 2008, we made $253 billion in interest payments.  Since you like the 1950s, in 1957 (the last year we made a payment on the principal of the debt), it was $5.5 billion.  The problem we have right now is the interest payments is all we make, and we keep borrowing more.  If we keep going this way, in 10-15 years, the interest payments will exceed our revenues.\n\n...and the problem we run into there (which will likely begin to manifest before that), is that the countries lending us money will begin demanding higher interest rates for their loans, on shorter terms, that the loans be made in their currencies rather than ours, and eventually will stop lending to us at all, as a high risk.\n\nWe can of course, at any point declare all debts held by the US null and void (repudiating the debt).  The problem with this idea is that we have a fiat currency.  That means our money is not backed by gold or any real thing, and is worth only what everyone else believes it is - and that belief is based on our ability to repay our debts and the use of our money as the world's reserve currency and the petrodollar.  If we repudiate our debt, our money will become worth less than the paper it is printed on, virtually overnight.\n\nThere are already movements internationally to move away from the dollar as the world's reserve currency, and to move away from the petrodollar for trading oil.  If we repudiate our debt, those movements will become reality, immediately.\n\n...and at that point we're basically screwed.\n\nFor example - one of the things the coronavirus is teaching us is that 90% of our medical supplies and 80% of our drugs are manufactured in China.  If our money is worthless, we can't buy those things.\n\nSo, it is imperative that we get our spending under control, and begin to pay down the debt.  In 1957, the military was 63% of our Federal Budget, and 10% of our budget went to pay down the debt.  In 2019, the military is 21% of our budget and we spent 27% more than our revenues.

Ontario has confirmed 17 new positive cases today. As I've talked about yesterday, the high increase of cases under investigation is uncovering the real grasp of how many people are actually infected by COVID-19. As a result of this increase Ontario has suspended public schools for 2 weeks (excluding march break). With the drastic increase of new cases and the potential for more each day, I will be switching to a table format for the information on each cases instead of just writing it out previously. Its essentially just copying the table on the Ontario website right now, but the problem with that one is that they don't show the previous cases, only the new ones. I'll be going back through my previous posts to compile all the info I've previously typed so that the table will have all the cases. \n\nSome silver lining with the current situation so we're not all doom and gloom, all the current cases we've had are all in self-isolation. This means that none of their conditions are severe enough for hospitalization. Furthermore there has been no additional cases of community transmission, today's cases all had a travel history or were in close contact with a previous positive case. Finally we're now past 4000 cases testing/tested, with the large increases happening during the past few days, showing the expansion of testing capabilities for Ontario. \n\n___\n\nCase Details\n\nCase Number | Patient Age and Gender | Public Health Unit | Hospital | Transmission | Status \n---|---|---|---|---|---\n43\t|50s Male\t|Hamilton Public Health\t|pending\t|travel (pending)\t|self-isolating\n44\t|&lt;18 |Female\tPeel Public Health\t|N/A\t|close contact|\tself-isolating\n45\t|20s Male\t|Toronto Public Health\t|Sunnybrook\t|close contact\t|self-isolating\n46\t|70s Male\t|Toronto Public Health\t|Mississauga Hospital|\ttravel (USA)\t|self-isolating\n47\t|40s Male\t|Toronto Public Health\t|St Michael\u2019s Hospital\t|travel (USA)|\tself-isolating\n48\t|60s Female\t|Region of Waterloo Public Health\t|Grand River Hospital|\ttravel (Puerto Rico)\t|self-isolating\n49\t|40s Female\t|Ottawa Public Health|Queensway Carlton Hospital\t|travel (Italy)|\tself-isolating\n50\t|20s Female\t|Toronto Public Health\t|Trillium Health Partners\t|travel (Europe)\t|self-isolating\n51\t|40s Female\t|Halton Public Health\t|Joseph Brant Hospital\t|travel (USA, Costa Rica)\t|self-isolating\n52\t|&lt;18 Male\t|Toronto Public Health\t|North York General\t|close contact\t|self-isolating\n53\t|30s Male\t|Toronto Public Health\t|North York General|\tclose contact\t|self-isolating\n54\t|20s Male\t|Toronto Public Health\t|Sunnybrook\t|travel (USA)\t|self-isolating\n55\t|60s Male\t|Toronto Public Health\t|Sunnybrook\t|travel (USA)\t|self-isolating\n56\t|60s Female\t|Toronto Public Health\t|Sunnybrook\t|travel (USA)\t|self-isolating\n57\t|20s Female\t|Peel Public Health\t|pending\t|travel (pending)\t|self-isolating\n58\t|40s Male\t|Region of Waterloo Public Health\t|Grand River Hospital\t|travel (USA)\t|self-isolating\n59\t|40s Male\t|Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit\t|Royal Victoria Hospital\t|travel (Spain)\t|self-isolating\n\n\n\n\n___\n\nOld Table\n\nDate | Confirmed Cases | Presumptive Confirmed | Cases Recovered (Unoffical) | Cases Under Investigation | +/- From Previous Day\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n[February 1st-3rd] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ey9gbk/2_confirmed_recovered_1_confirmed_cases_and_29/)| 3 | 0  |2| 29 | +12\n[January 31st] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ews46v/1_confirmed_case_recovered_1_confirmed_case_17/)| 3 | 0 |2 | 17 | -10\n[January 30th] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ew9zze/2_confirmed_cases_and_27_cases_under/)| 2 | 0  |0| 27 | +4\n[January 29th] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/evpx1q/2_confirmed_cases_and_23_cases_under/)| 2 | 0 |0 | 23 | +12\n[January 28th] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ev7fie/1_confirmed_case_1_presumptive_confirmed_case_and/)| 1 | 1 |0 | 11 | -8\n[January 27th] (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/eupoxr/2_presumptive_confirmed_cases_and_19_cases_under/)| 0 | 2 |0 | 19 | 0\n\n___", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584055672, "id": "fkcljnj", "author": "Scyllarious", "link_id": "t3_fhpw0j", "parent_id": "t3_fhpw0j", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Ok, let's have a look at how this thing happened. \n\n1. In January, when this virus thing first happened, there are plenty of comments from the US politicians criticizing the Chinese government. They blame the Chinese government for \u201csuppressing the severe situation\u201d for not locking down Wuhan and \"violation of human rights\" for locking down Wuhan. There are other ridiculous ideas like \"spreading of the virus in China helps the economics of the US\". Mike Pompeo insists on using \"Chinese virus\" in interviews when WHO has officially called it CODIV-19. The Chinese government is not happy with these reactions, warning the US government to not do things based on cold war thought. Also, the Chinese government is unhappy that the US government never officially helped China, which is also kind of ridiculous. \n2. As you may already read, there are articles in English saying that the virus might come out of the Wuhan P4 lab. There are also articles in Chinese saying the virus was brought by the US army in November. These articles, before Feb, can only be found in some private Chinese social media, which was never mentioned by the Chinese official media. These articles normally draw the conclusion first and have a timeline of indirect evidence showing that the US government is suspicious. If you have average IQ as I do, you'll know these are not likely to be the truth. \n3. However, things changed after the virus spread in the US and the US CDC announced that some previous death because of flu was actually because of the virus. They didn't say who's the patient and when that happened. The Chinese government found this weapon and decided to attack back. They did it in a smart way that officially, they announced the source of the virus is a scientific question and the conclusion should be based on research. However, the new spokesman Lijian Zhao says the virus could come from the US and ask for an explanation from the US government, **on Twitter,** probably inspired by Trump himself... Also, Beijing never officially said that \n4. Then during a call between Pompeo and Jiechi Yang, Pompeo officially says that the US is unhappy with Lijian Zhao's condemn and believes it's not the time to spread lies. In return, Jiechi Yang is unhappy about US politicians' ridiculous judgments on Chinese efforts for stopping the virus. \n5. Trump himself, as an honest politician, probably didn't know anything about Zhao's twitter in the beginning. In a news conference several days ago, when asked about Zhao's twitter, he (after praising Chinese government for having good numbers on infected cases and showing off his good relationship with Xi) says he didn't know what happened but believes \"everybody knows where it (virus) comes from\". Now, probably after listening to a report from Pompeo or other of his coworkers, he decided to attack back on **Twitter** by calling it a virus. Before that, Trump has never called it the Chinese virus neither officially nor on Twitter. \n\nSo in general, nobody really cares about where the virus comes from. (if they do, it will be a scientific arguing with tons of jargons that most of us won't be able to fully understand) It's just used as a weapon by both governments to attack each other. This fight is interesting because both countries are acting relatively friendly on the surface but quite aggressive on Twitter. From the perspective of the US people, the Chinese government will be ridiculous (and evil) because the virus is from China since it's first found there. For Chinese people, it will just deepen the evil image of some US politicians. They probably won't know about Zhao's twitter because Twitter is a website that never exists. \n\nSadly, we won't see the two strongest countries in the world help each other this time, like what happened in Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 or during Katrina in 2005.", "subreddit": "worldnews", "created_utc": 1584468255, "id": "fkrg84o", "author": "ks374", "link_id": "t3_fk40jd", "parent_id": "t3_fk40jd", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "that was a reference to the catholic church banning marriage of priests by the way.  i think the idea is that they could do a better job if they're not also caring for a wife -- that they could give more of their time to god.\n\nif the pope were married his wife could look out for him by telling folks to not kiss his ring and what not during the coronavirus scare.  she can also make a nice soup.  and if that wasn't comforting enough, she'd probably have a magical vagina a la curb your enthusiasm season 10 episode 7.\n\nbut no, the pope insists he can't have a wife because another pope said so -- even though he could countermand it.  he's all in when it comes to keeping up appearances.", "subreddit": "worldnews", "created_utc": 1583238653, "id": "fjcw0ai", "author": "newstimevideos", "link_id": "t3_fcs87r", "parent_id": "t1_fjcvkzo", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": true, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "&gt; # NUS students allegedly abuse Covid-19 measures to cheat on exam\n\n&gt; To protect students from the coronavirus, the National University of Singapore (NUS) allowed them take a practical examination at home.\n\n&gt; But despite being warned not to cheat, a significant number allegedly shared their answers and plagiarised each other.\n\n&gt; NUS is now scrutinising their submissions and identifying the alleged cheaters so action can be taken against them.\n\n&gt; Replying to queries from The New Paper, a spokesman for the NUS School of Computing confirmed it is investigating, with instructors still making plagiarism checks and have yet to finalise the results.\n\n&gt; \"NUS takes a serious view of academic dishonesty and does not condone plagiarism,\" she said.\n\n&gt; TNP understands Mr Prabawa Adi Yoga Sidi, the lecturer teaching the module, sent out an e-mail about a week ago urging students who had cheated to confess.\n\n&gt; It is believed that several have come forward and admitted to plagiarism.\n\n&gt; The exam is worth 15 per cent of the final grade for the programming methodology module, which is compulsory for engineering students.\n\n&gt; The module, also known as CS1010E, is described as an introduction to fundamental concepts of problem solving, involving the use of computing and programming in the Python programming language.\n\n&gt; The spokesman said about 680 students are taking the module in the current semester.\n\n&gt; CLASS SETTING\n\n&gt; The exam is usually held in a class setting, but in light of Covid-19, Mr Prabawa allowed it to be taken at home earlier this month.\n\n&gt; Students had to log in at the same time to work independently on three tasks, comprising seven questions, and submit their answers online.\n\n&gt; The spokesman said students were reminded that there would be plagiarism checks and penalties if they were caught.\n\n&gt; According to NUS policies, students who plagiarise or aid and abet such actions may be subject to disciplinary action.\n\n&gt; \"In addition, the student may receive a reduced grade, possibly even a zero mark, for the relevant academic assignment, project or thesis, and could receive a failed grade for the module,\" said the spokesman.\n\n&gt; \"Any student caught plagiarising will be required to retain the plagiarised module as graded.\"\n\n&gt; Numerous posts on Facebook page NUSWhispers in the past week claimed to be from students taking the module.\n\n&gt; Some claimed they had cheated because the conditions were difficult and it was to be expected, while others said they had learnt their lesson.\n\n&gt; One post, addressed to Mr Prabawa, claimed that if disciplinary action was taken, it would be the school's fault that \"almost half\" of the students would be severely affected and face problems with graduation and finding jobs.\n\n&gt; Another post said students were \"begging for mercy\", as the plagiarism checks are \"almost a death sentence\".\n\n&gt; Commenting on one of the posts, Mr Prabawa said the instructors were able to measure similarities in submissions and identify possible collaborations within groups, and this will be investigated further.\n\n&gt; \"Plagiarism is not a victimless crime.

Since last year, there has been a major increase in scam activity.\n\nMany tech support scams are executed while a user is browsing the Internet and unknowingly clicks a link that produces a pop-up warning that says their computer has been hacked or needs service. The warning provides a phone number for tech support. If the consumer takes the offer and lets the \u201ctech support\u201d person into their PC, they often end up with a locked computer that is held \u201dransom\u201d for payment or a virus that accesses the owner\u2019s personal information.\n\nLast month, a senior citizen from Grand Island, Nebraska, received a pop-up on his PC from a company called TeamViewer offering to clean up his computer for $299. He agreed to it and used a credit card to pay for the service.\n\nThe new twist to this scam is the victim received a phone call from a man stating, \u201cDue to your age, the government is subsidizing any payment made and will refund your money.\u201d Another caller informed him that his refund had been deposited into his account. He checked and saw that a $2,300 deposit had been made. Then a third caller stated that there had been a terrible mistake because $2,300 was more money than he was entitled to have for this service, and the victim was instructed to wire $1,950 to Fuming Lui in China. He was told he could keep the remaining $350 for his trouble. The victim proceeded to wire $1,950 plus an $18 transfer fee to China.\n\nWithin a day, the victim checked his bank account again and found that $,5,000 more had been deposited. Another caller instructed him to wire $4,500 back, and again was told he could keep the rest. Fortunately, the place where he had wired the first amount was closed, and Western Union was \u201cdown\u201d at a different wire transfer location. Fortunately, he did not send any money the second time.\n\nThen, in another twist to this scheme, the victim discovered that the perpetrator had never deposited money into his account. Both the $2,300 and the $5,000 deposits had actually been transferred by the scammer from one of the victim\u2019s other accounts. He told BBB that TeamViewer must have been in his PC to get his account information.\n\nThroughout this scheme, the calls the victim received came from phone numbers, all with different area codes. Several calls showed up as \u201crestricted,\u201d and one of those calls was from \u201cAlex Smith at Microsoft.\u201d\n\nAnother consumer from Omaha has also reported to BBB that he had received a phone call from TeamViewer in June. The caller asked if he was having any issues with his PC. He told the caller that his computer was running slowly. He agreed to pay $162.99 for two years of support and to have his computer cleaned up. He paid by credit card, set up a password and allowed TeamViewer to remotely access his PC. Although this consumer has not seen any improvement in the functioning of his computer, TeamViewer has been calling him every week, since June. Two weeks ago, the caller asked the consumer if he wanted to purchase some kind of security protection. He said \u201cNo,\u201d he has changed his credit card number and has not heard from TeamViewer again. He is also having his computer checked for viruses locally and is monitoring his credit card statements and credit reports.\n\nThis scam is known by several names: PC Support Scam, Fake Microsoft Support Scam, Tech Support Scam and TeamViewer Scam. Scammers use free remote connection software for remote tech support to help perpetuate their scam.\n\n \u201cEven though there are ongoing efforts by federal authorities to shut down these scams, cyber criminals seem to have become more determined and creative in their tactics to rip-off consumers,\u201d stated BBB President and CEO Jim Hegarty. \u201cRegardless of how the contact is made - by telephone or on a screen pop-up, the scam only works if the scammer gains the trust of their potential victims.\u201d\n\nBBB advises that if you receive a call claiming to offer tech support:\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t give control of your computer to a third party who calls you out of the blue.\n\n\u2022 Do not rely on caller ID alone to authenticate a caller. Criminals spoof caller ID numbers. They may appear to be calling from a legitimate company or a local number, when they\u2019re not even in the same country as you.\n\n\u2022 If you need tech support, look for a company\u2019s contact information on their website, software package, on your receipt and check out the company at bbbinc.org or call BBB at 800-649-6814.\n\n\u2022 Never provide your credit card or financial information to someone who calls and claims to be from tech support.\n\n\u2022 If a caller pressures you to buy a computer security product or says there is a subscription fee associated with the call, hang up. If you\u2019re concerned about your computer, call your security software company directly and ask for help.\n\n\u2022 Never give your password on the phone. No legitimate organization calls you and asks for your password.", "subreddit": "news", "created_utc": 1445282666, "id": "cw5hfyj", "author": "tarkay", "link_id": "t3_3pcvhz", "parent_id": "t1_cw5d113", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "&gt;I wanted a source for there being projects to mutate corona virus. You provided sources that studies on past corona viruses was going on.\n\nYou should have been more explicit in your question. That's not what you asked.  Obviously there is no way to know what unpublished work was being done. It can only be observed what kind of work was a primary focus of the laboratory and under the specialist umbric of the people who worked there. If any bioweapons research was being done there, it would undoubtedly be classified.\n\nThere are a number of phrases suggesting that mutagenic impacts were being analyzed. China wasn't the only place conducting this kind of work, and the lab is cited as a source of various materials and samples in papers published from other places.  \n\nObviously it's pretty intuitive that work being done on a virus would be important to understand the function of infectivity and possible genetic transcription impacts.  This is true whether for the purpose of public safety research or for more military based research.\n\nIn 2013 lab itself sequenced a number of extracted samples and found that there was a wide variety of coronavirus strains. To do this, it would be reasonable to assume the samples had to be procured and stored for analysis.  Given that a number of follow up studies were done over the past seven years, it is reasonable that the process would involve keeping cultures rather than gathering additional samples when needed.\n\nThe labratory was the first to successfully isolate the virus \nhttps://www.ecohealthalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Ge-et-al-Bat-SARS-like-CoV-that-uses-ACE2-Nature-2013.pdf\n\nWe can assess that the team at the institute had a high degree of specialization in extremely infectious diseases.  BSL level 4 facilities are designed expressly for the capacity to handle these types of pathogens, in particular live strains.  \n\nGiven the proximity to the outbreak, I don't see how an accidental release can be ruled out without a definitive chain of transmission through natural processes can be proven.\n\nTo date, such a chain has not been adequately demonstrated, (I note you didn't source one), as such it is a matter of two distinct possibilities both of which are potential avenues.\n\n&gt;Are you suggesting that the virus is a bioweapon that went directly from lab to humans, without using animals for initial spread? Or do you think that since a couple of months after it appears we still don't know which animal it came from, it must be a bioweapon?\n\nI am not suggesting any particular route of transmission. There are a number of ways that such a transfer could occur.  A direct virus escape is possible. Failed sanitation processes when working with a live virus are possible.  Escape or deportation of an infected lab animal is possible.  Ultimately there are many paths to a systemic breakdown that can occur.  Most such scenarios involve the usual problem, the typical weak point in most security systems, the human element.  Such errors can be do to malice, cascading mistakes, or a single point of failure.   Accidents of this nature are not unprecedented in either industry or research labs.\n\nAt the same time, a natural chain of events is also plausible. \n\nUntil either possibility is confirmed or (much harder) absolutely ruled out, both are valid hypothesis", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1582398780, "id": "figeooj", "author": "escalation", "link_id": "t3_f706aq", "parent_id": "t1_ficw4dp", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Not sure on this as a blue collar worker (uneducated wage slave), but....\n\nIsn't the current trend for businesses that are public traded (sell stocks) to prioritize short term stock price at the expense of other categories involved in managing a business. ie: cash on hand, long term stability, work force, etc...\n\nCheap, low interest cash = Lets borrow for all expenses on a monthly basis so we can put everything else into short term stock values. ie: stock buybacks\n\n\nLet's face it.

People were scared and security was increased. As I grew older, the United States of America grew more and more paranoid, until eventually the Social Justice Warriors had had enough and decided to secede and create Femitopia, a country where only women, gay people, or non-white people could get in, and those who weren't that were executed on the spot for being \"cis privileged scum\". Eventually the USA got fed up with Femitopia because they set up their country along the borders of Mexico and they allowed Mexican drug dealers to stay in their country because they weren't white.  So, because the drug problem was overwhelming, the US staged a nuclear war on Femitopia, where North Korea backed up Femitopia and China and Russia backed the US. This is getting into the 2010 years now, but I'll keep going. The nuclear war ended when Femitopia attempted to launch their sole missile, the \"Trigger\" bomb, into New York City, but instead hit Canada, who got so enraged that under coked out Prime Minister Rob Ford, pulled a blitzkrieg that would make Nazis shit their pants and eventually Canada took over all of North America, except for Detroit. Nobody want Detroit. Eventually, North Korea also had another nuclear attack on the Empire of Canada, but because it hit Los Angeles and LA was now Canadian soil, Canada took over North Korea and eventually the rest of the world within 80 days of hockey and Tim Horton's fueled rage. However, LA became a wasteland and had mutants, and the mutants decided they didn't like Canada, so the LA mutants somehow summoned Cthulhu and managed to use his power to create Godzilla and resurrect Hitler as a cyborg. Now the LA mutants stated to take land from Canada like wildfire, but eventually stopped in Las Vegas because the whores there seduced them and murdered them all because the whores were actually ninjas. However, the whores got Super Ebola, Spanish Flu and Dire AIDS (like AIDS, only dire) from the mutants and the new plague destroyed all but 5% of the population. By that time, the year 2017 to be exact, all 5 billion humans remaining decided to send back 7 people, including me, to assassinate John F. Kennedy, the man who's famous speech \"Rape is Illegal\" was used as inspiration to create Femitopia. After killing JFK, all 7 of us were teleported to random eras in time. I got teleported to 2014 and found this cool website called Reddit, where I wrote all about the history of the world since the 2000s in a thing called an Ask Reddit thread.

I am unbelievably worried.\n\nForgive me for the length of this comment, but I am tense and I am angry. My mind is going a million miles an hour right now.\n\nI just biked seven miles across the city, and was horrified by the crowds of people doing the exact opposite of social distancing tonight.\n\nAs most everyone knows, this weekend we celebrate St. Patrick's Day. This is a very large celebration in Chicago, a city with tremendous Irish heritage. It is also, quite frankly, an excuse for people to get sloshed. Were it not for this pandemic, I would probably be out with them.\n\nBut I'm not. I turned my friends down and have been self-isolating for three days now. Let me tell the internet why, I guess?\n\nLast summer, I abruptly moved back home with my parents (50F and 60M) when I split with my partner of seven years. It's probably for the best that I did, because my mother has a laundry list of chronic health conditions. She is morbidly obese and anemic (this is an ongoing problem that we're actually still trying to determine the reason for). She has a history of complications from lower respiratory infections; she had pneumonia twice last year, and has scar tissue in her lungs as a result. She has the beginnings of heart disease, as well as an aortic aneurysm that is currently being monitored every six months (yep, I'm not joking).\n\nShe is still working (and actually works a very high-stress job in healthcare administration), but her health emergencies are ongoing. She has been working from home all week.\n\nIf I bring this virus home to my mother or she is infected elsewhere, she could die. At 50.\n\nAnd then there's myself. I am unsure how much of a risk this virus is to me personally. I'm young, only 30. I'm \\*very active\\*, though I am overweight (working on it). I do have adult-onset asthma.\n\nSince my diagnosis, I've had a few rounds of bronchitis and resulting asthma flare-ups. I was on a twice daily controller medication for a year, but am actually doing really well now, and have been able to go off controller medication. My asthma is \"well-controlled.\" I have my albuterol inhaler for emergencies and that's it.\n\nAs far as I understand it, both bronchitis and pneumonia are considered lower respiratory infections (unlike the common cold, which is an upper respiratory infection). A history of lower respiratory infections seems to indicate greater susceptibility to them in the future.\n\nI'm fairly confident if I get infected with this virus, I am going to have a ROUGH time. On the other hand, I also don't truly have any reason to believe I'll die or like, need a ventilator. Despite my history of asthma and LRIs, my lungs are functionally normal right now, and I'm otherwise healthy.\n\nStill, it's important to remember that this virus is novel to humans. We can't predict everything about its behavior with the same accuracy that we can a virus that has been around for a long time. It hasn't been studied extensively. Quite simply, we don't totally know what it's going to do to every group of people.\n\nThis whole thing is also so crazy to me for personal reasons, because the only reason I ever joined Reddit eight years ago was to track the Ebola outbreak, LOL. I've always tracked viruses and outbreaks as just like, a hobby, and I have never felt this way about one EVER. Every credible source is saying this is going to be unlike anything we've ever seen.\n\nAnyway, I've been reading everything I can find all week. Every statistic, every study, every opinion. I'm not panicking because of the media. I'm panicking because all evidence I've read indicates my mother is highly likely to experience complications if she contracts this virus. Because I believe that my history with asthma and lower respiratory infections \\*might \\*be a risk factor as well.\n\nBecause scientific authorities, NOT politicians, are saying that this is about to explode. The writing's on the wall. We are trying to slow it down, not contain it at this point. Staying apart will save lives. Even Trump in all his idiocy seems to be acknowledging the severity of this. Of course, I have zero faith in his ability to lead in a crisis, and I believe real political upheaval is on the horizon now as well.\n\nI lived through 9/11 and this feels like something on that scale. Like, there's going to be a pre- and post-coronavirus divide in my memories now. It's just inevitable.\n\nLast summer, my mom was in the emergency room at Northwestern for a bout of gastrointestinal bleeding. It was a massive internal bleed that led to hospitalization as well as her ongoing anemia.\n\nThe ED was full and they had no room for her all night. She laid in the hallway in a bed, bleeding, until the morning came and they finally got her a room.\n\nThis is a woman WHO WORKS FOR a large hospital (not Northwestern, to be clear). She has the best health insurance available. She has the means to pay for pretty much anything in terms of medical treatment.\n\nNone of that matters when there aren't enough doctors and nurses to go around.\n\nUnless you're fucking Jeff Bezos or the President, money's not going to buy you a doctor in the midst of a public health crisis of this scale.\n\nDo you want people to die peacefully surrounded by those they love, or do you want them to die in the next three months, in a hospital hallway without care because hospitals are slammed with patients and doctors are collapsing from exhaustion?\n\nDo you want those doctors to have to pick and choose who gets treatment?\n\nTo have to turn people away over and over because they don't have enough ventilators?\n\nBut yeah, bars and restaurants were packed tonight. Big crowds in Lakeview and River North. People carrying on as if authorities aren't BEGGING people to stay home and socially distance themselves.\n\nAt the corner of Clark and Ohio, a man and his friends yelled out to me, \"Nice bike!\"\n\nI yelled back, \u201cGO HOME!\u201d\n\nAs I was coming South on LaSalle, the Board of Trade loomed into view. I sat back in my saddle a bit and looked up.\n\nLiving here, I frequently take the cityscape for granted. It's my everyday. But tonight felt so different. I felt like I needed to burn it all into my memory, just in case. In case I'm stuck inside for weeks or months evading this stupid fucking virus, as well as my friends and loved ones who are currently refusing to stay home if they can. It breaks my heart to see them doing this, but there's nothing I can say to convince them. They know what they're doing. They just don't care.\n\nI also have a lot of friends in the service industry, or who work only part-time, or are paid under the table, or are having their hours cut already. I have friends who are comedians and musicians who are having gigs canceled left and right, and don't know how they're going to afford to live. Welcome to the gig economy in a major metropolis. They have rent to pay and food to buy. I don't blame them one bit for going to work if they can. They are trapped.\n\nThose bartenders and servers and cooks out there exposing themselves to these crowds tonight need their wages. They need their tips. They have to expose themselves to infection to pay rent. It's so fucked. This country is so fucked, you guys. So unbelievably fucked.\n\nMy city's about to experience a public health crisis the likes of which hasn't been seen in a century. All because of some combination of selfishness, apathy, ignorance, and misinformation. And because people can't afford not to go to work tonight. When we look back on this crisis in the future, historians will study and acknowledger the role economic disparity played. \n\nI also think addiction plays a part, as to be totally honest, there are people out there who truly value going out to the bars more than anything else. More than their own lives and the lives of their loved ones. This makes me so sad to think about. And some of them...they're just young. They're immature. They're carefree. They haven't developed enough awareness of the consequences of their actions yet. They will soon enough.\n\nUltimately, there's nothing I can do. My Reddit comment won't save the day.\n\nIf I'm wrong, awesome.

Call around to local farms, too, and see if they're selling to the public! A lot of them will have lost a lot of business with the restaurant closures.

They may not have everything you need, but I'd rather start with them and fill in the blanks at the grocery store after. \n\nBreweries are selling their draughts in growlers (which isn't new, but some will have special offers or limited availability beers that they normally don't sell that way.) Wineries are offering deep discounts, and some will even deliver. I've heard distilleries are even making hand sanitizer! \n\nSchools are still feeding the children, by the way. Look to your public school district's information page, most are offering free bagged meals (breakfast and lunch) for pickup daily for ANY child aged 1-18, current enrollment not required. Homeschool, private school, graduated, not in school yet, it doesn't matter. The public school district will feed them for free. Mine is also offering to sell those meals to any adults who want/need them at a really reduced rate - I think it's $1 for breakfast and $2 for lunch. They're even sending the school buses on daily modified routes to deliver these breakfasts and lunches to designated bus stops if you want to avoid going to the actual school or can't get there. \n\nMeal delivery kits are another way to get food into your house barring all of the rest. They can be pricey, but some are quite reasonable. They all have some kind of special introductory offer, usually something like 30% off your first kit, so you can rotate through them and try out various options. I don't want to advertise for any one or the other, so just Google meal kits and you're bound to find a ton of options with special offers. \n\nI *will* advertise for www.fullcart.org though. I haven't tried it myself yet, but it is by far the least expensive. It is more of a grocery box of frugal, shelf-stable items, and exactly what people are looking for right now. They've got the pasta, rice, beans, lentils, oatmeal, etc that you likely won't find with your local farms. It's very affordable, and for anyone who needs it due to COVID-19 they are offering emergency assistance.\n\nAnd of course, if needed, food banks and community drives are seriously ramping up their efforts. They know that people will be needing their help a lot more than normal in the coming weeks and months. \n\nGood luck, I hope you're able to find the things you need.

In one case at a regional office, a UN employee seconded to the WHO was found to have \"invited a female intern to lunch in his apartment, where he touched her inappropriately\".

Inside China there is a growing sense of helplessness, as the government is compelled to take drastic measures to stop the virus, including introducing some travel restrictions in Beijing. I have received panicked queries from journalists and public health workers in China, asking, \u201cHow can we protect ourselves and our families?\u201d\n\nThe epidemic could have been controlled fairly easily three weeks ago had there been more openness, swift action, and no attempted cover-up. But now it\u2019s too late, and this virus is spreading globally. Because there is no vaccine or treatment for nCoV2019\u2014the Wuhan pneumonia\u2014and infection has spread throughout China, the government is forced to turn to its 2003 SARS playbook. And that means entire cities must be cut off, and the population of the nation must be restricted in its movements and potential disease-spreading behavior. It is not surprising then that travel out of Beijing may be forbidden; the entire mainland could go on lockdown soon.\n\nI know people are very frightened. And I expect panic will rise in the coming days. But very simple measures can protect you.\n\nDuring the SARS epidemic, I traveled all over China and Hong Kong, interviewed people infected with the virus, doctors and nurses treating the disease, government officials, police\u2014everybody. I was never concerned that I would become infected, despite being in the room with sick individuals. And that\u2019s because I knew what precautions to take. Here are the most important ones to know:\n\n1. When you leave your home, wear gloves\u2014winter mittens or outdoor gloves\u2014and keep them on in subways, buses, and public spaces.\n\n2. If you are in a social situation where you should remove your gloves, perhaps to shake hands or dine, do not touch your face or eyes, no matter how much something itches. Keep your hands away from contact with your face. And before you put your gloves back on, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water, scrubbing the fingers. Put your gloves on.\n\n3. Change gloves daily, washing them thoroughly, and avoid wearing damp gloves.\n\n4. Masks are useless when worn outdoors and may not be very helpful even indoors. Most masks deteriorate after one or two wearings. Using the same mask day after day is worse than useless\u2014it\u2019s disgusting, as the contents of your mouth and nose eventually coat the inside of the mask with a smelly veneer that is attractive to bacteria. I rarely wear a face mask in an epidemic, and I have been in more than 30 outbreaks. Instead, I stay away from crowds, and I keep my distance from individual people\u2014a half meter, about 1.5 feet, is a good standard. If someone is coughing or sneezing, I ask them to put on a mask\u2014to protect me from their potentially contaminated fluids. If they decline, I step a meter (about 3 feet) away from them, or I leave. Don\u2019t shake hands or hug people\u2014politely beg off, saying it\u2019s better for both of you not to come in close contact during an epidemic.\n\n5. Inside your household, remove all of the towels from your bathrooms and kitchen immediately, and replace them with clean towels that have the names of each family member on them. Instruct everybody in your home to only use their own towels and never touch another family member\u2019s. Wash all towels twice a week. Damp towels provide terrific homes for viruses, like common colds, flus, and, yes, coronaviruses.\n\n6. Be careful with doorknobs. If it\u2019s possible to open and close doors using your elbows or shoulders, do so. Wear gloves to turn a doorknob\u2014or wash your hands after touching it. If anybody in your home takes sick, wash your doorknobs regularly. Similarly, be cautious with stairway banisters, desktops, cell phones, toys, laptops\u2014any objects that are hand-held. As long as you handle only your own personal objects, you will be ok\u2014but if you need to pick up someone else\u2019s cell phone or cooking tools or use someone else\u2019s computer keyboard, be mindful of not touching your face and wash your hands immediately after touching the object.\n\n7. If you share meals, do not use your personal chopsticks and utensils to remove food from a serving bowl or plate and, of course, tell your children to never drink out of anybody else\u2019s cups or from a container of shared fluid. It is customary in China to prepare several dishes for a meal and then allow everybody at the table to use their personal chopsticks to pull food from the common dishes: Don\u2019t do this until the epidemic is over. Place serving spoons in each dish and instruct everybody at the table to scoop what they want from the serving dishes onto their personal plates or bowls, return the serving spoon to the main dish, and then use their personal chopsticks only to pick food from their personal plate or bowl into their mouth. Wash all food and kitchenware thoroughly between meals and avoid restaurants that have poor hygiene practices.\n\n8. Absolutely do not buy, slaughter, or consume any live animal or fish until it is known what species was the source of the virus.\n\n9. When the weather allows, open your windows at home or work, letting your space air out. The virus cannot linger in a well-ventilated space. But of course, if it is cold or the weather is inclement, keep warm and close those windows.\n\n10. Finally, if you are caring for a friend or family member who is running a fever, always wear a tight-fitting mask when you are near them, and place one on the ailing person (unless they are nauseated). When you replace an old, dirty mask from the face of your friend or loved one be very, very careful\u2014assume, for the sake of your protection, that it is covered in viruses, and handle it while wearing latex gloves, place it inside of a disposable container, seal it, and then put it in the trash. While wearing those latex gloves, gently wash the patient\u2019s face with warm soap and water, using a disposable paper towel or cotton swab, and seal it after use in a container or plastic bag before placing it in your household trash. Wear long-sleeved shirts and clothing that covers your body when you are caring for your ailing friend or relative. Clean everything your patient wears or touches very thoroughly in hot soapy water, including sheets, towels, and utensils. If you have space, isolate the sick person in your household in a room, or a corner of a room, where they are comfortable, but separated from the rest of the household. If the weather is tolerable, open a window that is on the opposite side of the room, so that air gently blows past the patient\u2019s face and then outdoors. Of course, don\u2019t do this if it is very cold, as your friend or loved one will be made sicker if uncomfortably cold.\n\nThe Chinese government will take very drastic actions over the next few weeks, and this will be a time of hardship for the Chinese people. As the virus spreads in other countries, similarly draconian measures may be invoked to slow the epidemic. But with these simple precautions, if taken by everybody in your household, building, office, and school, you will dramatically reduce the spread of the virus and bring the outbreak to its knees.\n\nBe safe. Do not panic. Take commonsense precautions.

But relatively few children appear to have developed severe symptoms so far, according to the available data.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe median age of patients is between 49 and 56 years,\u201d according to [a report published on Wednesday in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2760782). \u201cCases in children have been rare.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So why aren\u2019t more children getting sick?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cMy strong, educated guess is that younger people are getting infected, but they get the relatively milder disease,\u201d said Dr. Malik Peiris, chief of virology at the University of Hong Kong, who has developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Scientists may not be seeing more infected children because \u201cwe don\u2019t have data on the milder cases,\u201d he said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIf this coronavirus spreads worldwide, and it spreads as widely as the seasonal flu does, probably we\u2019ll see more,\u201d he added.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In one published case, a 10-year-old traveled to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, with his family. Upon returning to Shenzhen, the other infected family members, ranging in age from 36 to 66, [developed fever, sore throat, diarrhea and pneumonia](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The child, too, had signs of viral pneumonia in the lungs, doctors found \u2014 but no outward symptoms. Some scientists suspect that this is typical of coronavirus infection in children.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that children can be either asymptomatically infected or have very mild infection,\u201d said Dr. Raina MacIntyre, an epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, who has been studying the spread of the new coronavirus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In many ways, this pattern parallels that seen during outbreaks of SARS and MERS, also coronaviruses. The MERS epidemics in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and in South Korea in 2015 together claimed more than 800 lives. Most children who were infected never developed symptoms.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No children died during the SARS epidemic in 2003, and the majority of the 800 deaths in the outbreak were in people over age 45, with men more at risk.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Among the more than 8,000 cases of SARS, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were able to identify 135 infected children in published reports.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Children under age 12 were much less likely to be admitted to a hospital or to need oxygen or other treatment, the researchers found. Children over age 12 had symptoms much like those of adults.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cWe don\u2019t fully understand the reason for this age-related increase of severity,\u201d Dr. Peiris said. \u201cBut we see that now \u2014 and with SARS, you could see that much more clearly.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It\u2019s not unusual for viruses to trigger only mild infections in children and much more severe illnesses in adults. Chickenpox, for example, can be largely inconsequential in children, yet catastrophic in adults.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Influenza is unusual in that it has evolved with humans over thousands of years and infects millions worldwide each year. Still, even though thousands of young children end up in the hospital each year with influenza, just a small percentage of them die, Dr. Peiris noted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Adults may be more susceptible because they are more likely to have other diseases, such as diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease, that weaken their ability to stave off infections.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The body\u2019s innate immunity, which is critical for fighting viruses, also deteriorates with age, and particularly after middle age.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cSomething happens at age 50,\u201d Dr. MacIntyre said. \u201cIt declines, and it declines exponentially, which is why for most infections we see the highest incidence in the elderly.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A key question about the new coronavirus is whether children who are infected and asymptomatic are able to pass the virus to others.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cWe know that young people in general \u2014 not just kids, but young adults and teenagers \u2014 have the most intense contact in society,\u201d Dr. MacIntyre said. Young people who don\u2019t realize they are sick may contribute to the epidemic\u2019s momentum, she said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To understand the epidemic fully, she and other scientists said they need detailed data: when people were first exposed to the virus, when they first began to show symptoms, how many and which people have mild symptoms versus more severe disease.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With detailed data, some observations, such as the higher risk in men, may change. Still, Dr. Mark Denison, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, said he does not expect to see a sudden uptick in infected children.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine that there\u2019s such a degree of underreporting of clinical illness in children that we\u2019re only hearing about two or three cases,\u201d he said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think it means that there are many, many less children\u201d who are infected in China, he said, \u201cand that they\u2019re not as much at risk.\u201d", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1581117794, "id": "fgucylf", "author": "TissueOfLies", "link_id": "t3_f0ir5n", "parent_id": "t3_f0ir5n", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "\nEmail from childrens.harvard.eu\n\n \nFYI (for staff)\n\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n \nFrom: AOD, Administrator on Duty\nSent: Tuesday, January 28, 2020 11:07 AM\nTo: netusers-dl\nSubject: AOD Advisory: Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\n \nIn an effort to best protect our patients, BCH will begin screening all employees, medical staff, volunteers and other Associated Personnel returning from travel to China. \n\u00b7         If you or someone who works for you has returned from China in the past 14 days, please call Occupational Health Services (OHS) for a health screening.\n\u00b7         If you have traveled to China in the past 14 days, or live with or care for someone who has returned from China in the past 14 days AND you have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, PLEASE STAY HOME and call OHS for screening.\n\u00b7         Occupational Health Services (OHS) can be reached at.\nPlease be advised that the CDC has issued a warning to avoid all nonessential travel to China.\nFor more information about BCH\u2019s response to the Novel Coronavirus see the website.  \n \nThank you,\nAdministrator on Duty (AOD)\n \nFrom: AOD, Administrator on Duty\nSent: Thursday, January 23, 2020 2:58 PM\nTo: \nSubject: AOD Advisory: Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\n \nAs a reminder, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital is now screening patients for the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\u00b7         Travel screening questions are in the process of being implemented in PowerChart and Epic asking patients about travel to Wuhan, China in the past 14 days (and fever, cough, or difficulty breathing).\n\u00b7         Screening questions will be changed as needed with updated guidance from the CDC\n\u00b7         For a positive travel screen:\no   Clinicians should give an ear loop mask to the patient and family\no   Place in a single room and close the door\no   Page Infection Prevention and Control at (#)\n\u00b7         Staff require an N95 respirator, gown, gloves, and eye protection (goggles or face shield) to enter the room.\nFor more information about the BCH Response please refer to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Website.\n \nThank you,\nAdministrator on Duty (AOD)\n \nFrom: AOD, Administrator on Duty\nSent: Wednesday, January 22, 2020 4:43 PM\nTo: \nSubject: AOD Advisory: SBAR Novel Coronavirus\n \n01/22/20:  BCH Response to Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nS\nOn Dec 30, China reported an outbreak of respiratory disease in Wuhan City.

The people were mostly like you'd find anywhere else in a \"first world\" country and while there was clearly a segment of the population that displayed the stereotypical Chinese \"don't give a fuck about copyrights or patents or QA or safety\" attitude, it wasn't pervasive or the norm from what I witnessed and was told.  I'm your stereotypical white American devil genetically and \"accent\"(yeah, I don't hear it either but people who I think have accents say we have accents so...) but experienced no apparent hostility other than scowls from a couple young men when their girls laughed and exclaimed something or another while pointing at me with my [frog umbrella.](https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server5400/pqt7n8/products/52/images/146/toy_umbrella-frog_l__02953.1355519041.1280.1280.jpg?c=2) Bruh, wasn't trying to swoop in and woo your girl with my blue eyes and even bigger eyes of my umbrella.  Just trying to stay dry in style and that was my favorite option at the 7-11 and I was apparently blazing the trail of HK umbrella fashion or maybe just an odd foreigner that failed to have an impact on HK umbrella fashion at all.  Either way, the point is that frog umbrellas are highly recommended and jelly young men of HK need to get one if they want to keep up with me.\n\nAaaanyway, Chinese society is more keyed in to reality than it appears on the outside.  The amount of surveillance, censorship, disinformation, fear and lack of options to discourages publicly discussing things that are forbidden by the government like anything critical of the PRC or positive about what the PRC considers their enemies. What happened in HK with the protestors was only possible because it's not considered part of China by most of the HK citizens and hasn't been for a long time(it was a British colony prior to being technically \"handed back\" to the Chinese government by the UK a few decades ago with the agreement that HK be allowed to operate under a \"one country two systems\" rule where HK was technically considered part of China but functionally autonomous for something like 100y, IIRC.  Unfortunately it seems the PRC no longer feels the need to keep their side of that bargain though and as they enforce more and more of their will in HK law, more and more of the HK citizens protest against it.  The thing is, you don't get what you want from the PRC by refusing to do what you're told unless you have a way to prevent them from retaliating. 1 million+ people protesting in unity against PRC laws and a subsequent vote that shows that it's the will of the majority of the HK citizens is likey more of a speed bump than a great wall, sadly. The numbers aren't a concern to the PRC but the international pressure and loss of income that would result from just disappearing so many people in such a significant international hub and gateway to China do make the PRC step carefully while responding to this situation.  That's not to say the PRC won't do exactly what they want in the end just that they'll do slow less blatantly and provide distractions while they do it so that there won't be as many repercussions as a result.  In the end China can take a huge economic hit and shrug it off since they have a ton of resources, finances and own a lot of debt from other countries like the US so they could simply call in those debts and make up for any sanctions or losses they accrue as a result if they have to and not really suffer for it.

It added that in the worst-affected area around 4% of the population had come down with the illness.\n\n\u201cFor this reason it was necessary to adopt the restrictive measures (of last week) ... that made it possible to contain, or at least slow down, the spread of the virus,\u201d it said.\nThe region said its local health network was able to cope because other hospitals, beyond the so-called red zone where the outbreak began, had been able to pick up the strain.\nHowever, local authorities are coming under huge pressure to ease restrictions, which include a blanket closure of schools, universities, museums and cinemas across much of the north, amid fears of a gathering economic storm.\n\nTourism federation Assoturismo said up to 90% of hotel and travel agency bookings had been canceled for March in Rome and up to 80% in Sicily, two areas barely touched by the virus, as school trips and conferences were called off and foreigners decided to stay away.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cItalian tourism never experienced a crisis on this scale in recent history.

Hern\u00e1ndez\nPublished Jan. 10, 2020\nUpdated Jan. 11, 2020, 2:30 a.m. ET\n\n\u9605\u8bfb\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u95b1\u8b80\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\nHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese state media on Saturday reported the first known death from a new virus that has infected dozens of people in China and set off worries across Asia.\n\nThe Xinhua news agency cited the health commission in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the illness first appeared, in reporting the death. The health commission said the patient, a 61-year-old man, died on Thursday night.\n\nForty-one people have been found to have the new virus, a coronavirus, and seven patients are still in severe condition, the health commission said, according to the Xinhua report. Two patients have been discharged, it said.\n\nThere is no evidence that the virus can be spread between humans, according to the commission. The initial cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, birds and other animals. More than 700 people who had close contact with patients, including 419 medical workers, have been put under observation, the commission said, adding that  no additional cases have been found.\n\nReports of the virus \u2014 a mysterious, pneumonialike illness \u2014 first appeared last month and have since aroused fears around the region, where memories of the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, which began in China and killed more than 800 people worldwide, still linger.\n\nThe man who died was a regular customer at the market in Wuhan and had previously been diagnosed with abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease, said the city\u2019s health commission.\n\nWhile no new cases have been detected since Jan. 3, questions remain. Experts have said the minimum incubation period for some viral infections is 15 days, suggesting that it may be another week before authorities can determine the full extent of the illness.\n\nReports of the man\u2019s death came just before the Spring Festival, China\u2019s biggest holiday, which begins Jan. 25, and a time when hundreds of millions people travel across the country. That mass migration raises the potential of spreading and worsening any outbreak. According to government estimates, Chinese passengers will take three billion trips in the next five weeks for family reunions and tourism.\n\nIn recent days, authorities have stationed personnel at airports and train stations across the region to scrutinize people who have visited Wuhan. The market linked to the virus is less than one mile away from a train station. Precautions include checking passengers for fever.\n\nAuthorities in the Chinese city of Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia have also stepped up scrutiny. On Saturday, South Korean officials said the illness of a Chinese woman they had placed under isolation earlier in the week was unrelated to the coronavirus, according to the country\u2019s Yonhap news agency. The woman had visited Wuhan and suffered from coughing the throat irritation.\n\nThe Chinese government has faced pressure to release more information about the virus. In 2002, after SARS, a dangerous respiratory disease, first broke out, the Chinese government tried to cover up the extent of the epidemic, severely undermining public trust. Some experts have argued that China should disclose more details about the recent outbreak, such as the transmission route, the incubation period and the ages and genders of the patients.\n\nChinese health officials have cautioned that more research is necessary to fully understand the new virus. The World Health Organization has praised Chinese health officials\u2019 response to the latest outbreak.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect animals and people, and some cause only the symptoms associated with the common cold. Health officials in China have said that symptoms of the new illness include high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions.\n\n\nThe alignment is shit I know.", "subreddit": "worldnews", "created_utc": 1578732020, "id": "fdueqgo", "author": "edontou", "link_id": "t3_en1svv", "parent_id": "t3_en1svv", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": true}, {"body": "**The Winning Victory Conditions For Humanity In The War With The New Corona Virus NCOV**  \n To me this is just a lesson for humanity to study and overcome.\n\nMany of so called public national leaders have declared war with the new corona virus COVID-19, mainly because they are scare the shit &amp; may lose their power over people if this continue for few months.\n\nIn every games, sports, and even war with aggressive invaders in history, you always know the winning victory condition before go into the battle and fight.\n\nBut now in the battle against with invisible legendary corona virus NCOV, do any of you who are working and get paid for the job relate to COVID19 even know what is the winning condition yet?\n\nDo you leaders/bosses even know and told you, yet?\n\nSadly, the answer is no.

Many of the actions involved in the Contain phase are also part of the Delay phase (e.g. detecting early cases, contact tracing). The Delay phase is designed to slow spread of the virus so that it is more manageable. This will involve some of the following actions, but not all of these will be implemented or implemented straight away:\n\n&gt;Action that would be considered could include population distancing strategies (such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings) to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, while ensuring the country\u2019s ability to continue to run as normally as possible. The UK governments\u2019 education departments\u2019 planning assumptions include the possibility of having to close educational settings in order to reduce the spread of infection.\n\nThe timing of these strategies is key. If they are implemented too early, they will be less effective. The government, Chief Medical Officers and other scientists will have to make that difficult decision based on their assessment of the scientific evidence. \n\nBasically, you can think of Delay as a tactical strike at the virus.
